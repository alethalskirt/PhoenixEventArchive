                    <div class="markdown"><em>The quarters had been stripped back to basics here. Commander Kunzo’s previous belongings must have already been moved out to the commanding officer’s quarters. The operations team aboard this vessel were highly officiant. The first thing that hit her was the amount of space here. The layout was incredibly spacious, even… Unnecessarily so. All previous postings had been aboard compact Romulan vessels and her own sleeping quarters aboard her yacht was tiny. This was a phenomenal difference. It was not as if she was going to complain. If this sort of thing was the norm then she would gladly accept it.</em> 

<em>Her bag was set down in the crook of the sofa so she could slowly pace around the rooms and take in the layout. It was exhilarating how everything was separate. The study, main living room, and bedroom were all partitioned off. She would have expected everything to be contained within the size of the living room alone. There were numerous spaces for ornaments and books, a small wardrobe for those horrid red-tinged Command uniforms that she could not get used to… And there was an entire bathtub within the head. Mhm, it was going to be difficult to coax her out of here. It was like she had just stepped aboard a cruise ship. And that was what a Starfleet vessel was, at the end of the day – a cruise ship where you could work upon. All of those hints of trepidation seemed to wash away. It felt nice to be back… And even better to be aboard a ship such as this.</em> 

<em>Silently pacing through the small study area she took note of the message that had been sent by Commander Kunzo. Unfortunately it had been sent the day before so she was likely too late, and as a result she swiftly sent back a note of apology. It was the least she could do. Figuring that she had better be prepared in case any further messages came through – and knowing that she would need to meet department heads and go for her physical – she decided to set about sorting out her quarters for now.</em> </div>

Of course this would be emotional for Ch&#39;evhalen. Difficult, perhaps. Inspiring. Who knew? Well, she did. It was impossible to ignore that wave of longing at the sight of the stars.</em> &quot;Normally, Commander... It is better. Perhaps I shall have to show you from the observation deck once we have departed Earth Spacedock once more. If this brief taste of <em>our</em> universe has you intrigued, then I am more than happy to indulge you. ...The sight of the stars never gets old, no matter how many times you look out there.&quot; <em>There was a hint of melancholy behind her own speech, too.

A’aehrel had found herself standing there, staring after him as he left – and then staring at the door for a good minute until she realised she looked like a statue within her own quarters. After a moment she forced herself to move, going from being completely still to slinking back through her quarters with an eerie grace.</em> 

<em>With Ch’evhalen gone she could finally go about unpacking the rest of her things instead of just her mass collection of botanicals for herbal tea remedies. Although, she was rather glad that she had handled that first. It had ensured that she could display some form of hospitality back to the Aenar, had it not? He had been so kind as to come and say hello to her upon her arrival, it was only fair that she displayed some form of kindness back… And despite how she had wanted to get on with her day and finish unpacking, talking with him had been… Nice.</em> 

<em>The concept of ‘friends’ had always been one that had brought conflict to A’aehrel. As she had grown she had learned that friends were not friends, they were colleagues only. Starfleet had helped to change that opinion. She had gone from one brainwashed society to one where emotional attachments were all but forbidden. Starfleet had been the complete opposite. In her first weeks at Intelligence she had almost</em> <em><strong>wept</strong></em> <em>at the sight of people who were allowed to be themselves, be free; be allowed to not be strictly professional and engage in some form of friendship. It was not a time that she liked to look back upon. She had been a wreck.</em>

Formality was what she was trained in but this vessel was so different. One part of her was enthralled at the concept of finally getting to know a person on a personal level instead of being strictly formal. The other part of her thought that the idea was completely vile. What had gotten into her? She was a trained agent, she knew to put feelings and emotional attachments aside… But she was allowed to have them, no? People were allowed to feel. She was allowed to.</em> 

<em>With what was almost a very Romulan snarl of irritation she sunk back into the corner of the sofa once more, fixing the wall opposite with a pointed glare just for something to do. Anger was one of the few emotions that you had been allowed; it helped to fuel your work. Why was she angry? She wasn’t, really. She was just conflicted. This way of life was all but foreign to her. Being so open and kind was something that she had always yearned for. She needed to stop being so hard on herself and let herself experience this. It would take time to adapt to the change but she could do it, couldn’t she? She could learn to be more open, more kind, more friendly. It was not going to do any wrong.</em> 

<em>Commander Ezran Ch’evhalen had already referred to them as friends. That had to be a reasonably good start, correct? They had talked like normal people – for the most part, minus her being relatively awkward now and again. She had apologised, though, because that was what people did. She had made him tea. They had established a telepathic link. She had allowed that – no, she had</em> <em><strong>suggested</strong></em> <em>that for some reason. It was a compassion that she would not give to anyone else, not to that extent. And why</em> <em><strong>had</strong></em> <em>she been so compassionate? What had drawn her to act in such a way? The lack of an answer only served to frustrate her.</em>

By ‘lazy’ it meant that she had finished decorating her quarters, everything organised meticulously to the way she liked it. Books were in alphabetical order, botanicals for different teas were dated and alphabetised, plants were dotted here and there and had electronic tags to track whether or not they needed watering. A finely sewn tapestry was tucked around the duvet of her bed with the precision of a hotel attendant; and the room’s holographic projectors, heaters, and speakers had all been fine-tuned to her specifications.</em>

<em>There had also been the matter of security. Not to say she was paranoid but working in the Intelligence field had made her… Yes, paranoid. There were additional locks installed upon the doors, pulse emitters to stop any potential bug from recording, a radius shield to prevent any unauthorised transporter access, encrypted communications lines established and intensive security set up upon her console. Even in the safety of a Federation starship one could never be too cautious.</em>

<em>While she was testing out one of these encrypted lines back to a couple of colleagues at Intelligence she noticed the message come through from Lieutenant Roode. Her PADD and consoles had all been synced up, of course. Personal PADDs were pointless in her opinion considering how people were born to work. Free time was not a concept that she was used to. The message brought the sudden realisation that was an event she was supposed to be attending – without a specific date or time or even location she had all but filed it away to the back of her brain until it was sorted out. My, the couple had left it rather late, hadn’t they?</em>

<em>This would be far easier if she actually knew the couple by more than just name. Getting to know her crew in-depth was something that she had strived for in the past. It was not for friendship, of course, but to know their deepest secrets and ideologies. It was something that she had intended upon doing with this crew; not to know their every thought, of course, but… To understand how to become more personable with them. If she understood their past and their positions then it would mean that she could connect with them better now. It was an endeavour to be polite – and to change her ways from the cold and distant Romulan method that she did not want to be known for here.</em>

Making the decision to finally get on with it and learn more about the crew, she plucked an incense holder up off one of her shelves and lit it before setting it down in front of the mat, allowing the two sticks to begin to burn and release the scent of myrrh. A’aehrel then took her place upon the mat; crossing her legs neatly, back straight, hands placed within her lap. In Vulcan practice meditation was used to purge emotion or begin a healing trance. Romulans had kept up the tradition but had used it in a different method. Whilst meditating you could harness all of your focus onto a single subject, and thus it was widely used for remembering mass amounts of information.</em> 

“Computer,” <em>she stated once she had shifted ever so slightly to become more comfortable,</em> “please read notable points in the personnel files of previously highlighted crew.”

Well known for diplomatic prowess and xenocultural knowledge.” <em>The mention of communications and diplomacy was not a surprise, A’aehrel thought to herself as she listened over the information. From the first moment that she had spoken to the commanding officer he had been nothing but perfectly polite, a very fine balance of friendly and formal that personally she could only dream of achieving. Perhaps the Captain might enjoy a conversation in the mixed Vulcan-Romulan dialect they had employed in the future.</em>

“Commander Dunamis; chief tactical officer. Brought up aboard the USS Riposte. Known strategist and competitive chess player at Starfleet Academy. Post-Vahar’ai.

Hopefully the officer was doing alright – a mental note was made to check up on him, some time. She had a myriad of things she could talk about when it came to botany. Maybe</em> <em><strong>he</strong></em> <em>would like a miniature astragalus. Would he find the gesture odd? Maybe. But it was better to try your hardest to be kind, was it not?</em>

Known for being distrusted for her lineage, prefers Federation citizenship to that of Romulus.” <em>Now</em> <em><strong>this</strong></em> <em>was an interesting one. It was not unheard of for defectors to be hunted down – A’aehrel had been sleeping with one eye open for</em> <em><strong>years</strong></em> <em>now despite being under the Federation’s protection. What was surprising was that she had not been accepted on Mol’Rihan. She had thought they were quite understanding, knowing people were all but brainwashed into the Tal Shiar’s service. Herself and this T’Nira t’Raindiell – who even used the Romulan postfix and all – could have some</em> <em><strong>very</strong></em> <em>interesting conversations.</em>

“Lieutenant Junior Grade Soval McFadden; chief helmsman. Raised amongst Starfleet officers and entered the Academy at the age of seventeen. Noted to be a highly proficient helmsman with a mastery of complicated manoeuvres generally not used on larger vessels. Has been demoted, promoted, commended, and de-commended on numerous occasions. Officers attribute his status as a ‘wild-card’ to his shunning of his Vulcan side.” <em>’Shunning of his Vulcan side,’ now that was something that she could understand. Had that decision been voluntary, she wondered, or had it been forced upon him? The majority of hybrids opted to learn the Vulcan methods – it was generally easier. In their brief previous encounters she had definitely noticed that slightly crazed attitude. Perhaps it was what made him a good officer, though.</em>

She didn’t recognise the man’s name, he must have been new aboard otherwise she likely would have seen him on away missions during their time-jump. A’aehrel could not help but wonder what these ‘creative methods’ entailed. It would be intriguing to watch him in the field in future missions.</em>

“Ensign Yoyo s’Tei; tactical officer. Raised by a Lieutenant of Starfleet and an Erein in the Romulan Republic. Distinguished in secondary education studies. Underwent the Kobayashi Maru thrice in order to improve. Noted by senior officers for being rather shy – psychological report states this has not been helped by being wounded in a battle against Tholians.” <em>The surname had immediately been noted, of course, considering it was rather traditionally Romulan. So the officer was a hybrid as well. Fascinating. A’aehrehl had not realised there were so many Romulan officers aboard this vessel. It would give her quite the opportunity to learn about the status of the Romulan Republic in the current time period.</em>

Xenophobia towards her own species was untoward, though. A Human brought up on Earth could not escape every single Human.

“Ensign Gabriel Monroe; weapons specialist. Great-grandson of known away-team leader Lieutenant Alexander Monroe. Known for patrolling neighbourhoods as a child, tolerated by local police. Has experience in both security and tactical fields but opted to specialise in tactical, noted for knowledge of different weapons.” <em>Fascinating. You would have expected the man to go down the route of security if he had been so involved in ‘patrolling’ his neighbourhood – a rather adorable concept, really.

Highly motivated in work within the science labs and has proven capability on the bridge.” <em>A Reman… Reman-Human? Another odd cross.

Most recent papers are under review by Starfleet Science and Wright is likely to be rewarded a Masters in Experimental Chemistry once approved.” <em>It was refreshing to hear that experimental work was still being conducted upon this vessel.

“Lieutenant Lihne Carter; archaeologist. Highly motivated in her field during time at the Academy and has worked on multiple archaeological sites since. Medical files indicate that she continually speaks with medical about implants to stop her pheromone production as she is Orion-Human, despite medical having given her a solution.” <em>Why harass the poor medical staff over an issue that had already been fixed?

That was all fair and well considering people often decided to specialise in one subject, but the woman was an ACSO. Who had granted her that position? A’aehrel would like to have some words. It would definitely have to be addressed.</em>

 “Lieutenant Junior Grade Sauon Oweyaan; xenobiologist. Born into an ambassadorial family of the Kazarite homeworld. Served as assistant ambassador and pursued scientific studies outside of Starfleet before opting to attend the Academy. Noted for work researching flora and fauna of the Gamma and Delta quadrants.” <em>A Kazarite… The species was rather rare, as far as she was aware. Of course if you could find one within Starfleet at all it would be aboard this vessel. They seemed to have everything here. Did the woman own telekinetic abilities? It was always something that had fascinated A’aehrel.</em>

“Lieutenant Junior Grade Mattel Kral; xenobiologist. Known as Matthew Allen. Host to the Kral symbiont. Focussed equally on Starfleet work and appeasing the Symbiosis Commission. Noted by the Commission for being very in-tune with previous personalities – something which is envied by other hosts.” <em>A Joined Trill. She hadn’t realised that there was one serving aboard.

Another archaeologist was good – it was a field often forgotten about despite the potential for information lying upon every new world they came across. Where did the hatred of the Commission stem from, though..?</em>

“Ensign T’lith; science officer. Parents disappeared when the officer was eighteen. It is a closed case, unsolved. Has experience in multiple science fields including botany, biochemistry, and astrophysics; making her a prime bridge officer candidate.” <em>Her parents had just</em> <em><strong>vanished</strong></em> <em>and it had never been discovered why? Now that was interesting. Crime was very rare within the Federation now and a disappearance was normally found out about. It wasn’t exactly A’aehrel’s job to go investigating cold cases but there was no way her curiosity was going to let her forget about this. Time to speak with her network and colleagues and see what she could uncover.</em>

“Ensign June Yashimaka; biologist. Born to a professor of Engineering at Starfleet Academy but opted to study science instead. Known for an avid love of animals which likely shaped her path into xenobiology. Apprehended for smuggling pets into her quarters at the Academy.” <em>Smuggling pets… Rather harmless until you found out that the pet was not friendly and it began to eat through everything you owned or something of the likes. There was a distinct difference between ‘pest’ and ‘pet’ and unfortunately some officers could not see it. If the officer opted to bring any pets aboard here then they would have to be vigilant for certain.</em>

Questioned during time at Starfleet Academy for conducting unauthorised experiments. Continues experimental biological research but now under observation from his peers.” <em>It was hardly surprising that the Trill was known for his research. He seemed to be quite the analytical and curious type – she had not spoken with him but had seen him in the depths of medical, working away. She had observed that he seemed to keep to himself unless required; someone who could at least monitor the work of others and keep them in line. It was interesting that there was no mention of what his more recent experiments were… She liked to keep up to date with what the crew were working on.

It was interesting that a Ferasan had found their way into the Federation at all considering their status as shiftier, genetically-engineered Caitians.

Known for bedside manner and positive interaction with patients.” <em>It seemed like quite the number of officers here had ended up within the fleet because their parents also served. This might well be an officer for Olson to train up for field work – but only if she could hack it, of course.

                    <div class="markdown">“Ensign Nela Feri; emergency room doctor. Noted for prowess in the pursuit of music and being part of a band which once toured Federation space. Stated on file that lecturers found her working on experiments on her own after-hours; a potential experimental researcher. Granted an BSc (Hons) for dissertation on the combination of traditional and modern medicine.” <em>Ah, so the woman pursued herbalism? This was pleasant to hear – so many people had forgotten about the use of botanicals in favour of a trip to the medical bay. If prescribed medication could not fix your chronic pains or ailments then why not try a method that had been used for thousands of thousands of years? And if you did not have access to modern medical solutions then it was your only option. It worked better than a lot of people cared to remember. She would have to speak with Feri on the subject at some point – A’aehrel was certain that they could have quite the intriguing conversation.</em> 

“Ensign Netwton Eirson; nurse. Heavily focussed on the medical field throughout Academy studies, although originally pursued a career as a surgeon before shifting to the nursing side instead. Academy tutors note that despite being distracted he is highly dedicated and capable and would not rule him out of pursuing further medical modules to expand his career in the future.” <em>Swapping career was not exactly unheard of in the medical field. It covered countless different clinical and academic aspects that it was easy to become intrigued in one and then the other. Going from being a surgeon to a nurse was quite the shift, but if it was one that the officer was content with then why not? Besides, it sounded as if Medical were happy to let him continue his studies so it was not as if he had done anything wrong. Nothing there to worry about, at least not in A’aehrel’s opinion.</em>

Originally served as a secondary-education guidance teacher and swimming coach. Later enlisted into the Technical Services Academy. Firm advocate of the link between Psychosocial and Security in order to help former abuse victims.” <em>At least amongst the mass trend of officers having suffered abuse there was someone to help deal with it – although A’aehrel was quite certain that the reason the man pursued such an endeavour was because he had been on the receiving end of abuse before, too. It was almost disheartening, even for her.</em> 

“Junior Petty Officer Bronwyn Bledig; counsellor. Raised by Starfleet parents aboard Deep Space Seven; enlisted in the Technical Services Academy and went down the medical route to become a counsellor. Served upon the USS Apollo, former UFHC vessel.” <em>Another enlisted officer, thankfully. There had been such a lack of them throughout this list so far that the Romulan was beginning to think that notable staff were only officers, and</em> <em><strong>that</strong></em> <em>would have been a concern to take to the boatswain, whoever they were. No, it was good to hear that there were enlisted people upon this list of hers – and it was nice to hear that they were counsellors of all things. Anyone could help another person regardless of rank.</em> 

<em>Another chime from the computer. Finally, she thought to herself, seeing as how it had felt like the list there was going to never end. Medical really did have quite the number of officers.</em> </div>

Constructed with the idea of imitating Human endeavours but conducting them better than the species. While serving aboard the USS Reynolds was noted for conducting the work of de-moralised officers resulting in the others being removed from the department. Known for making efforts to raise morale.” <em>Another knee-jerk reaction; a shiver down the Romulan’s spine. ‘Ghost’ was an</em> <em><strong>android.</strong></em> <em>He must have remained off-duty during her time here before – there was no way she wouldn’t have noticed him. How sickeningly amusing that the android had likely attempted to help his colleagues aboard the Reynolds only to have them removed for failing to work… Or perhaps that had been his motivation all along, conniving and conspiring in order to have other officers kicked out. Now, it was not as if she still had that intrinsic Zhat’Vash hatred of artificial life drilled into her… But the</em> <em><strong>anxiety</strong></em> <em>regarding them was still there. Lieutenant Commander Ghost was going to be watched rather closely.</em> 

“Lieutenant Junior Grade Shilen Alaya; operations officer. Raised aboard starship vessels to Bajoran parents, entered Starfleet Academy with recommendation from the Commanding Officer of the USS Galashiels. Highlighted for firm knowledge of starship engineering and ship mechanics, an asset to engineering teams, and worked on construction of the USS Phoenix.” <em>That was an interesting one. It must be fascinating to have watch this ship be put together piece by piece until you were capable of actually serving aboard it. Operations was always a department that fascinated her. They were so fantastically versatile and had the capability of stepping into the shoes of any other department if required. It was pleasant to hear that engineering could have the extra help should they require it.</em>

Stopped smugglers aboard Deep Space Ten by apprehending pirates who had stowed away on board.” <em>There it was again, another operations officer who could fill the position of departments other than their own if needed. Zh’ashrellil sounded like she would do quite well in tactical or security if they ever needed the extra assistance. Perhaps A’aehrel had ought to be writing all of this down so she could assign it to the officers later. Her to-do list really was growing.</em> 

“Lieutenant Junior Grade Oskar K&#246;nig, formerly Schneider, Intelligence attach&#233;. Raised by two Starfleet officers, one of which was deceased in a science accident. Known to be at odds with his father. Previously studied to enter the science route and served as a computer specialist within the department before being invited into Intelligence.” <em>Who exactly had invited him into Intelligence, she could not help but wonder. If the man was a ‘computer specialist’ or hacker as was more common – and she knew he was, she had seen his work – then it was probably CYSEC… But CRCO for some reason had a fascination with this ship. Either way, what was it with officers and having such poor relations with their families? And officers and changing their names, too? It was as if everyone had issues. The poor counselling staff were probably overrun at every hour of the day because of it.</em>

Skilled in numerous languages and linguistics – having knowledge of both the spoken language and the technical aspect of communications.” <em>There it was again, another to help engineering during a crisis. It was good to see that someone around here knew how to do the more technical side of communications work as opposed to just talking down a microphone. It meant that A’aehrel wasn’t going to have to do everything herself every time they had to alter a relay or frequency to get a message to somewhere stupidly far-flung.</em> 

“Ensign Flynn Calder; operations officer. Raised by freelance archaeologists known for the re-discovery of the fallen USS Triumph. Opted to enter the Operations route and is noted for aspiring to enter the Command training programme.” <em>This one could help with science, presumably, considering how his parents had been archaeologists. That was interesting. Normally people went down the same route as their parents did or at least had a very firm reason for changing. There had been nothing at all about why this officer had entered Operations instead. Another interesting case and one she may have to enquire about it one day.</em>

Originally seemed to lean towards the engineering route while at the Academy but then specialised in operations and transporter studies. Highly skilled in strategy and analysis.” <em>Either engineering or security for this one, then, given his record… Although A’aehrel was not certain that she would trust the man on the other end of a rifle if he were to assist with security. He had been awfully vocal when fighting back against her presence aboard the Phoenix during their time-jumping missions. In fact, she had never had the opportunity to discern</em> <em><strong>why</strong></em> <em>the man had acted in such a way. Perhaps they ought to have a chat and clear the air… How she despised people who did not follow orders.</em> 

“Ensign Amelia Colquhoun; administrative specialist. Adopted by human parents despite being Bajoran. Known during her time at the Academy for conducting work in laboratories; also highlighted for voluntary work at the Academy’s student union. Noted by classmates for struggling with being Orion in a human-dominated society whilst also having been raised by Humans.” <em>It would appear that not everyone had the same balance over their upbringing that Ensign Y’Saer from earlier had managed to achieve. Colquhoun’s situation was understandable. When you were a species which was traditionally distrusted by the Federation it led to a lot of awkward conversations and often feeling as if you could not fit in. It must have been particularly difficult for the poor Orion. Hopefully the woman was managing to get the support required – A’aehrel would keep an eye out for her.</em>

Fluent in Orion, Standard, Andorian, Bolian, Vulcan, Romulan, and Bajoran. Trained as both a xenolinguist and graduated Magna Cum Laude – also trained in systems engineering and interspecies ethics.” <em>Another Orion, and another communications officer. This one seemed to be more about the languages and linguistics themselves but that was quite alright… And she</em> <em><strong>did</strong></em> <em>have the technological side of things down if needed. Oh, to have a conversation in pure Rihannsu again. It had been years upon</em> <em><strong>years</strong></em> <em>and she missed the language, truly. Standard was pleasant enough but nothing would ever be as satisfying as speaking in your own mother tongue amongst people who truly knew the language.</em> 

“Ensign Copernicus King; Intelligence attach&#233;. Trained in xenolinguistics and communication; aspired to join the diplomatic corps before being blackmailed by an elder brother – files indicate the man, Dacre, had been working for Section 31 before being apprehended. King worked his way into Starfleet illegitimately but later came clean. Instead of being removed from the fleet he was placed under the tutelage of Starfleet Intelligence’s communications division.” <em>A’aehrel remembered this one happening. It had been quite amusing to track King’s movements as he pretended to be his ‘deceased’ elder brother, attempting to uncover the truth. Of course MADD and CRCO had known about his presence all along but he wasn’t doing any harm – and they wanted to see how well he could do. Intelligence was quite obviously where he belonged. The man would have done well in MADD with undercover skills such as those.</em>

Autumn must have been newly snatched up and taken into their ranks. Not as if that was a bad thing – it would be hypocritical of A’aehrel to think so considering her entire life had been spent in the field of espionage and counter-espionage. It might well give the woman a chance to learn more and develop skills that she would have wasted by sitting around in the science division. She would need to have a chat with all of the officers at some point and find out exactly how they had been taught to function aboard these ships. The three lied outwith her own network – and of course, they would have to be brought into it.</em>

Could the officers around here not get a break? Did not a single one of them have a pleasant childhood which was not filled with trauma? It was not as if this definitely emotionless Romulan felt any form of upset on the behalf of them and wished that their childhoods could have been better, no, not at all… But that was exactly what she did. It was incredible how these people had managed to pick themselves up and move on, though. Going from the death of your parents to later becoming a chief of engineering – it was the ultimate statement of being able to work through what the universe had tried to throw at you.</em> 

“Lieutenant Pasto Nix; Assistant Chief of Engineering. Raised on Vulcan for most of his childhood before being raised at the 40 Eridani A shipyards. Entered Starfleet Academy in order to bolster existing engineering knowledge. Noted by Starfleet Engineering for being highly creative and able to come up with new solutions while working under pressure.” <em>Pasto Nix was one that had already come up in her previous readings; you could not ignore the notes which indicated he was the one to turn to in a pinch. The man had apparently remotely controlled an entire older-style starship and had managed to beam a colleague out and prevented her from falling to her death.

It was an interesting combination, engineering and morale… But if it worked, it worked.</em> 

“Lieutenant Junior Grade Malcolm Parsons; warp specialist. Raised by Starfleet parents“ <em>again, really? She was getting bored of this, it was dreadfully repetitive.</em> “and was recommended into Starfleet by his father’s own commanding officer. Granted a BSc (Hons) in Impulse and Warp technology for his dissertations on impulse and warp systems. Also holds a knowledge of transwarp systems.” <em>So it seemed that the Lieutenant here was the resident when it came to getting the ship to its next destination.

It seemed like every Trill, joined or not, seemed to have some sort of convoluted relationship with the Commission. It was fascinating.

Entered Starfleet Academy as a means of competition with the rest of his brothers. Highly skilled and capable of outdoing colleagues in combat simulations, but noted for being rather awkward when interacting with colleagues – requiring counselling skills to develop interaction. Later commended for defending the USS Wildrider against the Voth.” <em>Poor interaction was to be expected, was it not, when you were not raised amongst a normal society and you were born to fight instead of do anything else. During the times when she had seen him about the ship the man had not been too awkward at all. It would appear that those counselling courses of his had worked. She only hoped that these combat simulations and apparent ferocity was matched with an equal discipline. A’aehrel had already witnessed him insulting a victim of Section 31’s control. She would not like to see him go through with any further misconduct.</em> 

“Ensign Thomas Jesse; security officer. Trained with his father – a Starfleet security officer – in phaser training and hand-to-hand combat from a young age. Later applied to Starfleet Academy to pursue a career in the security field; also studying tactical analyses and interspecies protocol.” <em>Finally, an officer who was trained in something more than just shooting another person. Interspecies protocol was all but</em> <em><strong>required</strong></em> <em>in order to help understand the customs of another person and to know how to de-escalate a situation. It was not as if the officer seemed to</em> <em><strong>use</strong></em> <em>these skills, though, there was no indication of helping a situation be resolved diplomatically instead of through phaserfire... Perhaps he just needed a reminder in what he had been taught. Perhaps</em> <em><strong>all</strong></em> <em>of the security staff could be doing with a bit of a refresher course in how to de-escalate first, shoot things later.</em>

Hirogen; born in the delta quadrant but brought to Federation space after being accidentally transported through a subspace corridor. Raised on Earth by a family of Klingons and Romulans. Recommended into Starfleet Academy after assisting a Commander who was being robbed, specialised in the security field as a result.” <em>A Hirogen… In Federation space… Aboard this ship. It was quite typical that of all the places they would end up it would be upon the USS Phoenix. There really was no end to the mass number of untoward species that they had on board. It was both highly irregular but also refreshing. The entirety of her life had been spent aboard Romulan vessels with Romulan people. Upon the planet of refuge there had been others but she had barely interacted with them, and at Starfleet Intelligence she had mostly remained isolated from the others. All of this change was such a contrast. It was anxiety-inducing, but it was also promising. Getting to know all of these people from other worlds… It would be a step forwards.</em> 

“Junior Petty Officer Breda Nowe; security officer. Bajoran, but raised on Earth. Enlisted in the Technical Services Academy largely at the wishes of her parents; resulting in the cancellation of her wedding to a fellow Bajoran. Has a strong awareness of Federation law and is noted for putting this into practice whilst apprehending potential criminals.” <em>And she was also known for insulting people who were psychologically compromised, A’aehrel recalled with distaste. Thankfully both herself and Lieutenant Tarna’Motlan had been apologetic when all of that was over but it had still served to irritate the Romulan to no end. Needless to say, JPO. Breda Nowe would be observed on any future missions in order to ensure that she was working to correct Starfleet standards.</em>

A’aehrel could not help but wonder, flickering one eye open and glancing upwards as if the computer would give her some form of visual indication that it was either finished or merely taking a break. She waited for a few moments and there was no continuation. Security must be rather understaffed too, then, considering how short their list was. Yet another thing to add to her to-do list would be requesting more staff of those departements.</em> 

<em>With a slow exhale she allowed the tension to release from the almost painfully perfect posture that she had been holding – letting her shoulders slump. Slowly she uncrossed her legs and all but slinked back up to her feet again… And ignored the sound of a couple of joints clicking as she did so. No amount of yoga, tai chi, mok’bara,</em> <em><strong>anything</strong></em> <em>ever seemed to work for that. Flexibility was fine, but stopping her right knee from clicking after having been stationary for too long? That was an impossibility.</em> 

<em>The two sticks of incense were snuffed out as she set them away once more, filling the room with that odd scent of smoke that wasn’t quite thick enough to be a nuisance but still contrasted with the myrrh’s own scent. Her head was all but reeling from firstly the thick resinous smell and secondly from the mass influx of information that she had just listened through. She placed one hand to the side of her head and fingers beneath her chin, slowly forcing her head to tilt to one side… And then suddenly quickened the motion, neck clicking. The other side was then done. It was likely a rather dangerous manoeuvre considering how she had killed people with similar, but she did not care… It was a good way of stopping yourself from feeling so horribly stiff.</em>

                    <div class="markdown"><em>Eyes wandered to the chronometer upon the wall. Trawling through all of those personnel files had taken longer than she had expected – and typically, she still had not managed to think up of some form of wedding present for the pair. They were typically presented afterwards anyway, correct? As unfortunate as it was it would just have to wait. Her time management skills were usually better than this, but it was not as if she was to blame… The couple had been</em> <em><strong>awfully</strong></em> <em>late in deciding when their ceremony was going to be.</em> 

<em>A’aehrel also did not regret going through all of the files. If anything it had made her more aware of her crew – their circumstances, their education, their skills, their hobbies in some cases. It was how you became closer to them. You could not converse with a person properly until you knew who they were. Most people established this through painfully awkward preliminary talks in which you slowly came to know one another. Why do that when you could cheat instead? And besides, above on a personal level, this ensured that she knew the skills of the officers aboard this ship. Knowing the staff meant you knew who to call on during certain occurrences. It was a knowledge that might well save the ship in a crisis.</em> 

<em>With another glare to the chronometer as if that would set it back – and she could set it back if she really wanted to, stealing the ship and pushing it through another time-jump – she figured that she should probably get prepared for this wedding which was to take place. Quietly she slinked off through her quarters. Time for a quick sonic shower… And perhaps some painkillers for her head. This was one time that she would accept the use of modern medicine instead of a herbal treatment. Something more quick-acting was clearly required today.</em> </div>

There was a vague sense of guilt at abandoning Ch&#39;evhalen and t&#39;Raindiell, but seeing as how there were so many people to speak with she figured her disappearance would not be too much of a loss for them. The ceremony had been pleasant to be certain... But social interaction with one person individually was not her forte, never mind with the masses. Informal settings did not compute well with her and to say she felt out of place had been an understatement.</em> 

<em>Heels had been kicked off as soon as she had stepped into the room. Spirits knew how much she hated them. The bath - set to a stupidly hot temperature which even most Vulcans would grimace at - was swiftly filled despite having gone for a shower earlier. Anything to all but submerge herself and let the heat wash away the tension in her shoulders and the headache from the masses of information earlier. A bath bomb had even been thrown into the water as well, turning it into a murky lilac-blue swirl. A&#39;aehrel was not one for being pampered but those things did always smell nice... And they did wonders for the skin.</em> 

<em>Her dress had been wrangled off and swiftly set aside for laundering and then she had stepped over the raised side of the bath, all but sinking into the water. She had ended up sat there beneath the masses of pastel-coloured bubbles, taking a moment to dip her head under the water before raising her chin to rest it upon the edge. Give it five minutes and her right shoulder would unknot itself... Hopefully. If not then she would have to break out the accupuncture kit and it wasn&#39;t exactly easy to conduct the process on yourself.</em>

The chime of the comms and Lieutenant Olson&#39;s message only highlighted the fact that she would have to head there shortly...

<em>Getting changed into uniform did not take long - but she</em> <em><strong>did</strong></em> <em>stop for a moment in order to glare at the red strip on the uniform which sat beneath the white of the jacket&#39;s shoulders. Red had never been her colour. The Romulan Star Empire had been very traditional in that their colour scheme consisted solely of black, green, and grey. Living on a refuge planet where dye for clothing was a luxury you meant you always wore beige... And Intelligence had been employing pure-black uniforms until recently, not a hint of colour to be seen. This red was a colour she did not appreciate but it was not as if she could fight the entirety of the Operations department about it. She would merely have to tolerate it.</em>  

<em>Whilst tying her hair to the side in that familiar braid she dictated out a list to the computer, having compiled all of the things that she needed to do.

Socialising was not her forte but she was willing to give it a try in order to get to know the ship and its crew… But truthfully, the idea did make her shudder. Formality had always been a key before. Informal conversation always felt odd… And as a result she only dictated out the on-duty work that had to be done, leaving a to-do list focussed around</em> <em><strong>socialising</strong></em> <em>to be done another time.</em>

<em>It was here that she allowed her shoulders to slump entirely and gave in to the low snarl that had been building. Hands scrubbed across her face as she snarled in frustration.

It was infuriating and she did not want to be infuriated, she had had enough of that throughout the day from certain department heads.</em>

<em>Frustration simply wouldn&#39;t do. She needed to clear her head. The incense sticks she opted for this time were made of frankincense, myrrh, and lotus. They were swiftly lit and set in front of the mat upon which she settled, legs crossed. Hands were placed in her lap and she concentrated on clearing her mind. Concentrated, concentrated... But instead of her mind clearing it just became hazy. Vulcans could go weeks without sleep and preferred meditation instead, Romulans were largely the same... But sometimes the exhaustion caught up and you could find yourself actually sleeping.

Incense sticks seemed to never last long enough and her ability to sleep was always the same. Falling asleep on the damned carpet of all things had not been intended either. Her neck ached as she dragged herself off the floor to sit upright, awfully stiff. Hands were placed beneath her chin and to the top of her head, slowly and rather forcibly tilting her head to the side until it clicked. Then the other side was done. Still not good enough, ugh… This was why falling asleep during meditation was not a good idea.</em>

<em>She dragged herself into the shower, letting the water run hot to the extent it was almost scalding. Starfleet ships and their luxuries, actual showers instead of sonic ones… They really were living the life here, even if their computer systems were painfully idiotic and they trusted androids and remans to hold department head positions. Ugh. Nothing she could do about that though, was there? …Other than monitor the two and have them removed if they stepped out of line in any way. And they would, because they always did… And she would catch them. Nothing went past her. It was her job to see everything, after all. Halfway through she changed the shower to a freezing cold temperature, using it to clear her head and remove the fog from falling asleep. Much better.</em> 

<em>Not too long afterwards she could be found dressed in uniform, hair braided immaculately, a cup of huang qi tea in hand as she read over the reports on her PADD. Footage from Lieutenant Olson’s bridge exam had been sent over to the nurse, hopefully it wouldn’t be too long until she opted to do the re-sit, A’aehrel didn’t want to wait forever. Lieutenant Bjorge’s still needed to be conducted, though. In fact… Why not now? It would get it over and done with, and besides… As a head of department, Bjorge was meant to be ready for anything.

Check the footage I&#39;ve just sent you, believe it already went through to your ready room but in the case you haven&#39;t gotten a chance to look at it I sent it here. Looking into it now but let me know your thoughts - I&#39;ll keep you updated.

                    <div class="markdown"><em>The Romulan had been here since all but stalking out of the holodeck the previous day. Her head hadn&#39;t stopped aching. It was completely stupid, a physical reaction to a mental conflict. Tea hadn&#39;t helped, nor had the painkillers she had choked back</em> <em><strong>with</strong></em> <em>the tea. She had ended up in the bath for hours, having the water constantly heated up. It didn&#39;t entirely fix the issue but at least it was relaxing. She missed the sea and the fresh air as she travelled on her yacht. The holodeck really did not make up for it - you could tell that the air in there was recycled and fake. There was something nice about the real thing that she missed.</em> 

<em>Afterwards she had set back to work once more, but this time she remained within the confines of her quarters. This was the benefit of still getting caught up with everything this ship had to offer - it ensured that you could work from home. She wasn&#39;t entirely certain if she was ready to join the others on the bridge yet either, unless it was completely necessary. Something about running these bridge examinations and speaking with the department heads had ended up troubling her. For so many years she had thought she was over the programming of her homeland - managing to scrape past the propaganda drilled into her head and learn to think for herself. Recent developments had proven otherwise. The android was someone she still wanted to kill on-sight, the reman she had come to despise immediately, watching Bjorge go to such lengths to save people on the simulation only highlighted how quick A&#39;aehrel would have been to condemn them, and sparring with Ch&#39;evhalen had shown that she could still be horribly violent.</em>

                    <div class="markdown"><em>It was all very jarring... And, uncomfortably, it was upsetting. Had she not spent years trying to be better than this? Of course Intelligence did not offer as much opportunity for personal development than a ship like this did. She was already being exposed to so many legitimately good people here, of course her opinions were bound to change… But it only suggested to her that, for all this time, she had never been good – not truly. Was she even going to be on the right path to</em> <em><strong>becoming</strong></em> <em>good now? Or was she going to fall upon those usual ways; hatred towards the android and the remans, despising everyone she came across. She wanted to be different. She wanted to do different, to become different, to</em> <em><strong>change.</strong></em> <em>Instead all she was met with was terror at the prospect and an incessant headache with all of the conflict, one which refused to leave no matter what. Not even mediating on the fact seemed to help. It was as if she was almost entirely lost… And being lost in her own personality was not a sensation that she enjoyed.</em> 

<em>One thing that always set her right again – or at least distracted her enough – was work. It was all she had ever known to do, after all. Sat directly in the corner of her sofa she scrolled through daily reports from the departments, idly fidgeting with the sleeves of her undershirt as she did so. Her skin had not taken kindly to the amount of time that she had spent in the water, now opting to itch at the masses of scars which covered her shoulders and upper arms. They were never visible, of course, even if they could almost pass for tattoos if they weren’t so raised and ragged. On her upper arms on both sides there were these sets of swirling, patterned scars – they could have been intricate and looked like some sort of artistic pattern. Those had been the result of torture-turned-bored-doodling when captured, many years ago… Or many years into the future, technically. They were not something that she tended to talk about.</em> </div>

<em>There were a couple of messages upon her PADD. Olson had gotten in touch to say that she was ready to re-take her bridge officer examination. This would require yet</em> <em><strong>another</strong></em> <em>trip down to holodeck one, but at least it would get things over and done with… And if Doctor Blanche Carlisle could return in order to have hers conducted then that would be fantastic. There was a message redirected from her ready room console, and then one in case the first had not auto-redirected – it was actually rather nice of the Captain to have considered that and forwarded it on just in case. But really, had he expected her to not have everything set up so she could work remotely at any time of day? Clearly he had not gotten to know her well enough yet. She was meticulous and rigorous and of</em> <em><strong>course</strong></em> <em>she would have been prepared in such a way.</em> 

<em>The message at hand was one about some sort of vandalism. There was even footage from the turbolift – a console screen being rather forcibly pried away from the wall. The reason was indiscernible considering how it had apparently been working completely fine. The vandal in question seemed to be Vulcan in appearance – being one of the species came with an advantage, you could always tell them apart from southern Romulans – but the posture was not Vulcan at all. V’tosh ka’tur, perhaps? The coloured strip upon her uniform was golden as well. Why would someone under the operations division want to destroy part of the ship that they worked to maintain or protect? This was downright confusing.</em>

This was… Unprecedented in her opinion, but she had never served upon a starship like this before. Perhaps Starfleet did things differently out here… And by differently she meant completely and utterly strangely. She just so happened to take a look into the new posting and forward the message to her new senior officer, just to ensure that</em> <em><strong>someone</strong></em> <em>would do something about it… But it was no longer an issue that the Phoenix had to deal with.</em> 

<em>It did not take long to go through the messages and reports. Despite the constant scratching sensation upon her arms, she tugged on her uniform jacket and zipped it up, straightening it out upon standing. She had left her hair to dry naturally; it had gone frizzy as always, something that she despised but could not control. There was no point in straightening it out, either. Every section of the ship had a different temperature and humidity depending on where you were; walk into the arboretum, for example, and it was a striking contrast to the hallway outside. Her hair would sense the slightest hint of moisture in the air and immediately frizz up again. Instead she tied it into the usual braid as best she could. Between that and the circles which had began to ring her eyes from the headache she looked a little bit les… Well… A little less completely pristine and uptight as always. Maybe it would make her seem more personable, who knew? She would find out sooner or later – but for now, she had to attend to Olson’s second attempt at the examination, and so plucking up the PADD she headed out to go back to holodeck one yet again.</em> </div>

Ch&#39;evhalen would remotely lock them too; but in the event that security&#39;s lock was undone, this would still keep people out. She did not wish to speak with people right now. Communication was difficult enough on good days and at present there was just far too much for her to deal with. Conversing with someone would only result in something negative occurring... Probably her snapping at them... Or harbouring some sort of deep-set hatred towards them... Or who knew. Maybe it would result in her killing them and not even being aware.</em> 

<em>It was still something that she did not want to think about. Every thought she had about it tore at her, feeling like it was trying to tear her apart from the inside out. Her stomach churned, her head reeled. All these years... All these years she had worked on controlling herself. She had coaxed her own brain through psychology strategies to re-write the conditioning done by the Tal Shiar; forcing you to believe their ideologies and never question them. From the day she was born that form of propaganda had been all around her. Of course that was going to be difficult to work past, and the Admonition had only cemented the viewpoint of ancient Romulan society, but... Years had been spent. It had been herself who had first begun to question their viewpoints, it had been herself who had worked year after year, tirelessly... And she thought that she was over it all. She thought that she had come to terms with it; the synthetics, the Admonition, Ganmadan. Coming aboard here had revealed the truth. The loathing against Android lifeforms still remained, the intrinsic dislike of the Remans refused to stop plaguing her.</em>

For years upon years now she had come to appreciate openness – the seas with the horizons that stretched on for miles, the desert of the refuge planet that she had once called home. These quarters were normally fine but right now they had turned into a cell, feeling like they were slowly shrinking and completely hell-bent upon closing her in. It sent her back to times that she did not normally care to remember; held in a cell and interrogated for weeks on end, being trapped in a temporal shuttle until the Tal Shiar scooped her up. Then there were the images that had truly triggered her fear of enclosure; planets being torn through, stars sparking out, and the universe seeming to condense until it was only one lone planet left. One did not go through admonishment without going a little ‘crazy’ as the humans put it – A’aehrel just didn’t show it content to let those bad days be as few as possible.</em> 

<em>Pacing around her quarters had not helped. Copious amounts of tea had not helped. Sitting in the bath had not helped, meditation had not helped. She felt like some sort of caged animal, desperate to escape. Every moment was focussed on one prospect and the outcome it would bring – the idea that she was a sleeper agent. The more she thought about it, the more horrified she became. She had gotten away from the Tal Shiar far too easily. Perhaps Ch’evhalen was right and they had willingly let her go. There were no gaps in her memory though – but were there? Were there and she had no idea? It couldn’t be… But it was a possibility. No, no, no.

If she could plan for anything and everything then she would - she far preferred to have a routine than to be thrown into something blind. Not that she was bad at improvisation - you had to be able to in order to command - but it felt... More</em> <em><strong>secure,</strong></em> <em>say, to have everything set out in advance.</em> 

<em>The first step was to finish the cool-down, going through numerous different stretches. There was no point in your legs being stiff the next day if you could avoid it, after all. Next it was to put her clothes into the laundry and then head for a shower. Fifteen minutes exactly was spent stood under scalding hot water. She preferred it that way even though it was known to aggravate the intricate scars that swirled over her upper arms and over down to her shoulder blades. There was no way to deny that she preferred the heat. It was the reason that the heating in her quarters was almost permanently turned on.</em>

<em>After that it was out and changed into clean uniform, pausing to inspect her jacket to ensure that there wasn&#39;t a single wrinkle or crease in sight. None. Perfect. Rank pips clipped to the collar, commbadge on.</em> <em><strong>Then</strong></em> <em>she had to go through the process of drying and braiding her hair, well aware that if she didn&#39;t it would just end up frizzy. It did not take too long until she was presentable... With a couple of hairs out of place. Ugh, she needed to find some new sort of hair-spray that stopped</em> <em><strong>frizz.</strong></em>

Ah- that gift from Lieutenant Bj&#248;rge. It had been a complete surprise to find it sat outside of her quarters, but it was a</em> <em><strong>nice</strong></em> <em>surprise at that. It would have been nicer if she wasn’t so paranoid. A’aehrel may or may not have done a bit of a forensic examination on it all first; determining if the handwriting was that of the Lieutenant, then investigating the contents. She was pleased to find that none of it was toxic in any way. Good… Because she did rather love a good cup of tea.</em> 


<em>Stopping to follow the provided instructions and brew a cup would mean her schedule was set back by approximately five minutes. Five minutes extra holed up in her ready room conducting rather monotonous work that she had already been trawling through earlier in the day… Or five minutes extra here – here where she did not like, considering how she felt confined within her own quarters at the best of times now – but having some nice new blend of tea to try as an outcome. …She was going to have to sort herself out and learn to stay down here for a longer length of time anyway… And so tea it was.</em> 

<em>The extra five minutes was worth it. A’aehrel used to completely despise the prospect of having any sort of beverage at your workstation… But had later found out that trawling through reports was made far better if you had a cup of tea with you. Not too long later than originally anticipated she headed out of her quarters, now content with a travel-mug of</em> <em><strong>rather</strong></em> <em>good tea in hand.</em> </div>

It was going to cause her Hell in the coming days, well aware that she would be a mess of aches and pains that no amount of warm water or homeopathic remedies could fix. She was already halfway there; migraine from the light, swirling scars upon her upper arms seeming to burn, neck aching from being hunched over at her console for far too long. Tension was only an added issue to numerous others, and additions were something that she had gotten used to by now.</em> 

<em>The door was immediately locked - standard method and then by two more algorithms she had programmed in that could not be bypassed by any form of authorisation. It would take a hacker to get through. There was no need for such added security, really, but it gave her peace of mind. If her quarters did not have a back door and everyone could see where she resided then she could at least make the place more secure. Openness terrified her. Life here in the Federation, that terrified her too. For so long A&#39;aehrel had yearned for it, pining over the prospect of conversation and relation and a normal life - and now that she was here, away from the clutches of Intelligence organisations, and safe? Now that she was here, she was throwing it all away.</em> 

<em>The issue was already right there in front of her.</em> <em><strong>Was</strong></em> <em>She truly away from the other intelligence firms? It was the source of her issues, was it not? How she felt she had moved on and removed all of that xenophobic sentiment but clearly she had not, how she was still</em> <em><strong>terrified</strong></em> <em>and completely and utterly desperate to prevent the world from the end which had become ingrained into her head three separate times. All of those years had been for nothing. Her mind was still a pawn to the Shiar ih&#39;Saeihr Rihan. That was what they always said - that once you were an agent, there was no escape. Perhaps they were right.</em>

To what extremes would she go, how much damage would she cause?

How could she expect some form of normal life when this was what she was doing? Numerous strands of her being screamed at her. She was well aware that it was all wrong... But then another part screamed back. Was she not right to act this way? Act in the best interest of them all? All she wanted was to keep them safe, at the end of the day. Her methods may have been conniving and sly and untrusting but they were methods nevertheless. Efficiency was her way of showing that she cared. A&#39;aehrel did not do praise, she did</em> <em><strong>correction.</strong></em> 

<em>And why did she not do praise? Why did she not give officers a smile, no matter however falsified, and state that she was happy with their work? Had she not managed it a couple of times before? A rarity, evidently. What was holding her back now? What was holding her back from the life she so craved, the one she had desired for so long, the one in which everything was normal and she was normal too? Why did the past continue to haunt her in such a way despite those years of feeling as if she had finally moved on? Ch&#39;evhalen had to be right, surely. A sleeper agent, activated, destined to feed back information to the Tal&#39;Shiar and remain their puppet forever. And would this have been voluntary? Would she have agreed to it, to become their little figure upon a set of strings? Was it forced, or was it her? Was it always her?</em>

                    <div class="markdown"><em>There was one way of knowing. With the doors locked and lights turned out she set about moving all of the furniture out of the way, coffee table shoved into the crook of the corner sofa, filing cabinet back against the wall, rug tossed aside. A singular isolinear rod was extracted from a bookshelf and plunged rather unceremoniously into her workstation, opening up the programme within. From the ship&#39;s own holoprojectors which were installed in every room - something she also did not like but had to utilise now - an image began to be projected onto the floor. It was scaled down ever so slightly to compensate for the size of the living area and the natural lanterns were replaced by a hologram, but it was very realistic. Normally specific prayer rooms were dedicated to this, but the Phoenix was not a Romulan ship and thus did not have one... And the holodeck was too public, too easy for people to intrude. Here would have to do.</em> 

<em>Her boots were removed and set aside, making her way to the start of the winding pattern upon the floor which seemed to curve into some form of ancient Romulan linguistic character. It was not often that she would undergo the Zhal Makh. When it came to meditation she had always preferred Vulcan methods - quick, easy, and efficient as ways to clear your mind. What if you wished to explore your mind instead of clearing it, though? Then the Zhal Makh was your only option; a meditative method which offered up the ability to export the depths of your own mind to find the truth. That was what she intended to use it for - discover the truth of everything she was experiencing. All of the paranoia, the anger, the fear... It stemmed from somewhere. If she was a sleeper agent then she would know. She would be able to tell. There would finally be clarity.</em>

That was the only time that she did not clearly remember every action - and therefore, it was the only time that she could have been activated. Focus... A step forward was taken. When you were doing this normally you would be able to sense your way using the heat of the lanterns against the bare skin of your feet. A&#39;aehrel did not require the heat; she had been through the winding maze enough times to know the pattern of the top of her head. Focus. Another step.

<em>Turn. She had entered lu shiar. It was time for details then, trying to fight past the haze which normally accompanied meditation. Every shuffling step forwards was accompanied by another detail, forming whatever had been on her mind during that meditation. Work, work, it was always work... Reports and personnel files and computer programming. The fog began to lift. Another step, and turn - now she had reached qlam wath. This was where details began to form together to create pictures. Time seemed to speed up with the haze completely gone; tired thoughts and feelings forming into one as she overviewed whatever she had meditated upon in these countless instances. It was all there, every detail; the more she focussed the more it sprung back to life... And the more it repulsed her, nauseating, already springing to the conclusion which she did not want to draw. The next step was all but forced, turning, turning...</em>

There was not a single instance missing - and every one ended with the sensation of clarity, being still and at peace, something which could not be achieved if you were not yourself.

Knees were drawn up to her chest, arms wrapped around them and hands curled back to dig nails into her hair. The other option would have been easier.

If she suffered from all of the above without any form of external influence, even after all of those years... If the issue was not with that she was a sleeper agent, programming activating to kick-start that xenophobia and fear... If she was not a sleeper agent?</em>

Dunamis and Roode would be next, Burns and Ch&#39;evhalen afterwards. They could all be made to look like an accident and Starfleet would be none the wiser, or... Or she could just get it over and done with.

Did she wish to kill 7-8KB who had done nothing wrong, Kunzō had been nothing but kind. He was dedicated to his crew... Something that she had lacked back when she had been the commanding officer of her own vessel. Her people had been pawns, completely expendable. She did not want to think about it. Had any of them done any wrong, really? What was she... What was she supposed to do? How did she claw her way back from whatever this was? How did she move on?</em>

If it was urgent then they would chime again or attempt to contact her via the comms. Considering how there was no further chime at the door it meant that it had not, in fact, been urgent… And therefore she did not, in fact, need to care.</em> 

<em>To say that A’aehrel was in a bit of a state was a classic understatement. After a while of remaining crumpled among the swirling scripture of the Zhal Makh holoprojection she managed to haul herself to her feet, at least. The projection itself was switched off and she managed to take a seat at her workstation, just… Staring. The realisation had hit her hard. On the one hand it was perfect; she was clear, she was not a sleeper agent, she hadn’t unconsciously gone against years of work to repay the Federation for what she had done during her time with the Tal Shiar and Zhat Vash. On the other hand it was the most difficult realisation that she could have faced. It meant that all of the xenophobia and continued hatred was coming from her – acting as exactly the sort of person that she was trying not to be.</em> 

<em>The issue now was what she was supposed to do about it. She could ignore it, and she very much</em> <em><strong>wanted</strong></em> <em>to ignore it, but ignoring it was a danger. If she didn’t do something then she would continue to sink. The feelings of desperation and hatred would come to a head, would they not, and the inevitable would happen – the death of 7-8KB and her falling back into her old way of life that she had tried so hard to move on from. She could try to acquire some form of help to move past everything and balance her emotions once again, but how? Undergoing Kolinahr? The Vulcans probably wouldn’t allow it. Speaking with a counsellor? Heavens no, as if they would be able to help her. Once you saw Ganmadan you were very typically un-helpable.</em>

A&#39;aehrel was well aware that such an attitude could be deemed as childish but in this case she thought it was rather understandable and entirely allowed. Ch&#39;evhalen had been the one to kick-start all of this, was he not? Everything had been perfectly fine until he had decided to</em> <em><strong>accuse</strong></em> <em>her of being a murderer. Well - a murderer aboard this ship. Her former occupation was no secret to the senior staff - her file, like anyone&#39;s - was accessible... But the fact of the matter was that Ch&#39;evhalen had been the one behind this drastic change in her, the one that had left her feeling as if she was hurtling through some rapid mental descent.</em> 

<em>The room was completely darkened. She had done the same here as she had done to her ready room. Lights dimmed, audio of all sources dulled, anti-recording frequencies up, multiple locks upon the doors, LCARS console display changed from that horrid Starfleet screen that made it look like they were trying to treat their officers like nursery children and teach them the fundamentals of primary colours. Her features were illuminated by the green light that she had changed the console to, a distinctly Romulan tone. It likely did not do anything to make her look any more put together but at this stage she did not care. It might as well be that she ran with it and hoped that how horrid she looked only made the Aenar believe she genuinely was unwell. It might make him leave quicker.</em> 

<em>Her gaze never wavered from the console... Or the floor directly in front of it. Her head was angled downwards either way. Her tone wasn&#39;t biting or scathing today, just... Worn.</em> &quot;Your offer is much appreciated, Commander Ch&#39;evhalen, but I am rather busy at the moment... Perhaps another time.&quot; </div>

&quot;There are times when, in order to eliminate a person, we do it as swiftly as possible. A clean-cut assassination. It can be disguised as natural causes or left be. At other times we do not wish for that. We utilise subtlety and slowly weave our way into the victim&#39;s life to slowly disrupt it. We break the trust between their family and friends. We ruin their reputation. We slowly whittle away their career. It impacts their mental health. They become paranoid, forced into a slow decline... And eventually they break. Either they snap at someone else - and attempt to kill them - or the fatality they decide upon is themselves. By the end of it all no one cares for their death...&quot;

<em>It was silent for a good few moments, time ticking on and on. It seemed as if she was frozen in place, shoulders hunched upwards and completely tensed up.

Her other hand went to join the first in holding up her head, now pressing palms into her eyes as if in an attempt to stave something away. The truth, perhaps.</em> 

<em>…And then her shoulders shuddered. It was a complete turn in the reaction, having gone from entirely tense to something that was entirely uncharacteristic once again. Her head remained firmly placed within her hands. It created the effect of muffling her voice a little but what she was saying was still discernable….</em> <em><strong>Just,</strong></em> <em>through both that and the fact that she was more than definitely choked up with no way of concealing it.</em>

A ‘tough time,’ as the Aenar put it, did not fit the bill. The time she was having was all but horrid. Admonition had sent her out of her mind and this felt like an exact repeat.</em>

<em>At least… It was strange, really, and likely rather morbid to think about it… But in a way she was rather glad that the Tal Shiar were behind it. It meant that she had not gone completely off the rails by herself. All of this time they had been influencing her thoughts and ideologies, forcing her back into her own ways, breaking apart the trust she had began to establish with the rest of the crew such as Ch’evhalen and Kunzo. It was quite silly; she really should have seen it earlier. She had been trained in the Tal Shiar method of corrosion and yet had not managed to work out that it was what was being done to herself… She was becoming too na&#239;ve nowadays.</em> 

<em>At least it meant that it was not her, though. It was not her, truly, who was behind the drastic shift in personality. She had not gone from wanting to do better to wanting to fit back into her own ways. It was all explainable now, and it might not have solved the problem miraculously, but at least it offered some explanation.</em> 

“Again, Commander, it is appreciated. I fear that my efforts to change, to fit in, to <em>improve</em> and be better have all but been undermined by my former colleagues… But I would much rather attempt to find the correct path again as opposed to continuing on this rather dangerous one. My next steps, however… What do I do now? Hand myself over to you for confinement to the brig, in fear that I may cause some sort of damage to the likes of yourself or Lieutenant Walsh? Or perhaps I should report to medical and declare myself unfit for duty. They have not handed me anything easy to handle…” </div>

It was completely unexplainable. Given how the Romulan was in a complete and utter state right now she merely filed it away as an other frustrating and downright stupid turn in her emotional state… Refusing to acknowledge the fact that, perhaps, she was jealous of the relationship the two potentially had. And of course it was sheer paranoia that she even thought such a relationship (that being more than friendship between the two) existed, but that paranoia seemed impossible to shrug off.</em> 

<em>The sensation of the Aenar placing his hand upon hers, though, seemed to dissipate that horrid feeling in what felt like only a second. It was like a jolt of electricity and her immediate reaction was to snatch her hand away, but by some miracle she repressed the movement and merely remained there, tensing once more. Despite that (and despite the fact that she was now talking through gritted teeth,) her words were still appreciative.</em> 

“If that would be alright with yourself it would be much appreciated. I… Am uncertain of how to explain this situation to them. Nor have I ever undertaken any form of-“ <em>she had to resist the urge to grimace</em> “-<em>counselling</em> before. It is an entirely foreign topic to me.
