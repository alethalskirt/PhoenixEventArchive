Life is returning to normal; as normal as normal can be in Starfleet service. It heartens me to see that the crew has improved; morale is high, and now, without the threat of impending doom awaiting us at every corner, one can now feel that things have begun to calm down. The crew has been through a considerable number of ordeals; but I sense that while there will be more ahead of us, we will be better equipped and better prepared for what lies ahead. Each and every one of us has been through a trial by fire - and from the flames has come a better, stronger, happier crew. <em>E cineribus ad astra</em> - from the ashes, to the stars. To a new beginning, for all of us. Let us see what the future brings.</span>

I believe that, without any compunction, I can say that the year has been interesting. The golden, shining possibility of a better, brighter future for all the crew, when we launched, seemed not so far away. 

But gradually, that dream seemed to elude us. Encounters with the Tal Shiar, the Borg, time-displaced humans from Earth&#39;s 21st century, and even the demons that lurk inside of us, waiting to rear their ugly heads in our moments of weakness, eroded that rosy ideal, sliver by sliver. I must confess that, like my fellow officers and every other person who serves with us, I found it challenging to see the light in this cloud of seemingly never-ending misfortune. 

Yesterday&#39;s events have made the year more interesting still. An encounter with our other selves - the mirror&#39;s reflection; the ever so slightly warped, sinister image that gazes back at us each time we stare into a reflective surface; the worst of what we could have been, made manifest. I despise my other self so. Nauseatingly casual, pompous, self-important, sadistic, cruel - I can find no other words to describe myself- sorry, him, better. 

But then, I look back at myself. How different, I ask myself as I record this, would I have been, had my choices in life been different? I do not have the answer to that question. I do not pretend to know in full what the choices I had available to me then were, and what lies ahead down the road, for myself, and for the rest of the crew. 

Perhaps, in some way, yet again, I have been taught a lesson. A lesson from which I take away the notion of ensuring that I do not become that which I most hate. I suppose in some way, I ought to feel some measure of gratitude to whoever, or whatever, placed the Terrans in our path. 

The road ahead looks bleak, even as the new year draws ever closer. I shall deign to not offer too much hope, or too much pessimism, to what comes.</span>

The new year continues to draw ever closer. Already I see that the crew has begun to find ways to usher it in - albeit not in the most... appropriate... of ways. I deny not the fact that, to say the least, we have been through hell and back. I deny not also the fact that the crew deserve a way in which to celebrate - to leave behind their troubles and worries as we transition into a new year, and hopefully a new period of hope. 

But actions must always come with consequence - it saddens me to do so. I cannot, in my position, leave overlooked the actions of a small number of the crew, for, for a few minutes, forgetting that there are appropriate places in which to celebrate, and that there exist places in which such events are undesirable. 

But from this incident I find myself taking away something unexpected: Hope. It heartens me to see that, to remedy their actions, the crew bands together to make things right. I see in them the new beginnings of cohesiveness, of teamwork. I believe I would not be wrong to guess that the crew, in all the hardship that has come our way, has been brought together, forged gradually into a team; into <em>family.</em> I can only hope that this will lead to better things to come - to a united crew, ready to face whatever comes. 

That rosy idea of a brighter future for us all once seemed quite unreal. But for now, I think that, as we bear upon the dawn of a new year, it seems not quite so far away...</span>

A mirror version of Commander Dunamis was the I.S.S. Pheonix&#39;s captain. Naturally we raised shields and charged weapons in kind to what posture they showed. However Commander Dunamis in the hail that occured offered Asylum to our Mirror selves. This was the beginning of the events that followed. Naturally we took aboard their wounded, guarded by security in the cargo bay with their most serious in sickbay. Commander Dunamis saw fit to leave the Bridge to meet his mirror counterpart, leaving me Command of the ship. Essentially leaving me high and dry for what was to come. He did return from sickbay and shared what he had seen, before retiring from the bridge once more. Moments after a rift occured and a large vessel emerged from it looking for our mirror counterparts. Had I known what was going to occur I would have turned them over to the vessel, going against the asylum granted by the first officer. Despite our precautions in handling our mirror selves they broke out and tried to take control of the ship, naturally when they got to the bridge I locked all the consoles out. despite multiple injuries including myself who was almost assimilated, and other bridge officers assistance did arrive in time to right the wrong before it was too late. Starting to believe a boring patrol would be a bit more this crew&#39;s pace but that&#39;s beside the point. We are recovering, and thats all I can. Thus I conclude this Second Officer&#39;s Log.</span>

I regret to preface this entry with the likely notion that the Federation and Starfleet might never be the same. Not in the eyes of our cadets, not in the eyes of those who would join our numbers and certainly not in the eyes of our allies - no doubt having heard of the events that transpired on this day, the Chancellor, Proconsul and Great Link must be shaking their heads. Disappointed. Amused, perhaps, in the eyes of some. Maybe gleeful. I shall deign not to assume at this juncture. Maybe a few worlds will cede, deciding that they wish to no longer affiliate with us. Earth is, after all, one of the lynchpins of the Federation - and I fear that today, we have loosened that pin. 

And then comes the notion of those whose lives were lost in this skirmish, in this exercise in futility. They shall be branded heroes, no doubt, brave ones who gave their lives fighting for what was right and what the Federation stood for. But I ask myself, how many more lives could we have saved today? Could we have accomplished what we did with diplomacy? Could we have convinced admiral Nazar to realize the error of his ways? I do not know.</span>

Most certainly - and I speak for everyone who lost a child, a spouse, a lover, a friend, as well as every other soul who did survive this tragic ordeal. It distubs me to see that some remain loyal to the admiral&#39;s cause - coerced, maybe, brainwashed into serving his cause. Tempted by the seductive promise of power conveyed with honeyed words. I shall not assign blame, regardless of what the cause is. I am reminded starkly of the danger of powerlust. I am reminded starkly that beneath the Federation&#39;s whitewashed, pristine facade bubbles corruption and treachery, as is the case with any and all societies. We must stay vigilant. Above all, however, we must stay true to what makes us us - what makes us Starfleet. We will rebuild. We will recover. We will take time to reflect on what has happened here today. And we shall most certainly spare no effort in remembering those who gave their lives to show that these values are, and shall always be, the shining heart of what it means to wear this uniform. 

 Phoenix&#39;s flame is dim. The crew is demoralized, having experienced loss far, far greater than I would ever wish on anyone in their shoes and so early on in their careers. But make no mistake: we will in time once more leap anew from the ashes, with fire brighter and stronger than ever before, and into the stars we shall soar, setting the stars alight. This is not the end of Phoenix. We will endure, now and forever. Let it be noted in this commander&#39;s log that today, with the exile, the great firebird once more brought back life and light. <em>E cineribus, ad astra.</em></span>

It pleases me so to preface this entry by noting that morale has improved much. Already I see the crew growing into each other; becoming closer, forming new bonds... which heartens me. It has been long since I have seen such joy on their faces. 

I shall deign not to use excessive imagery in this entry - there is simply no better way to express the joy I feel inside at this juncture. <em>This</em> is what Starfleet is about. Hope. Bonds. The rush of excitement that comes each and every time a commander and their crew embarks on yet anothet mission.

But yet I am also reminded of the last time this happened - at the beginning of Phoenix&#39;s journey from Spacedock. It was a preface to more than a year of hell and stress. Will this time be different, I wonder? 

Oh, pish posh. Of course it shall be. We are stronger. We have come through our trial by fire and emerged victorious. At last our  efforts have been noticed by the benevolent gamemaster of life. This time <em><strong>will</strong></em> be different. We shall simply have to make it happen. This is Starfleet. We shall set a course for that distant star and go towards it at with all possible speed and bravery. Phoenix&#39;s fire will not die. The day on which we are one again ready to embark on our journey draws ever closer, and I cannot, and will not, restrain the feeling of excitement that fills me so. 

I&#39;ve been told several times that I ought to have myself some fun - relax with the crew, let my nonexistent hair down. For the record, I cannot understand why humans use the phrase and where it came from. Perhaps the pool party tonight shall be a good first start.</span>

It has been far too long since I wrote one of these. I believe I stopped sometime after the Silescu crashed - recording how we all felt whilst stranded there had gotten rather upsetting - and I just never picked it up again. I’m not entirely sure that this should even be classed as a captain’s log – I’m not the current commanding officer, nor am I a captain… And they keep changing the classification of what’s technically a personal log as well. Ah well… Here shall do. 

Words cannot express how trying recent times have been. From being placed under the control of the Obsidian Order, to discovering hexalithium, to saving Andor, then the Alpha Quadrant, and then Starfleet from corruption... This vessel and her crew never seems to slow down. Not a single instance has been positive, not really. The outcome has been of course, but it&#39;s the getting there that is the issue. I fear for this crew: for the ones who have had to fight through it all. There will be ensigns who have never seen a true space battle before who may have watched their friends fall; crewmen who were the only survivors on decks which were hit; senior staff who will be consumed by the guilt and that horrible feeling that they should have been able to do better. They are a marvellous crew, all bright minds and strong souls, empathic and courageous and compassionate. They deserve far better than what the universe has provided so far. 

Despite the hardship, though, they never fail to astound me. They show their prowess and skill under pressure and then afterwards, in those quiet hours when the weight of the world suddenly becomes prominent upon their shoulders? They band together. They stand with one another, and they stand <em>strong.</em> If one falters then there is always a hand there to guide them and help them back to their feet... I could not be prouder than I am of this crew.

The universe may throw more hardship their way but like always they will prevail. There is always a light at the end at the end of the tunnel, as the Humans would say... Although why they are going through a tunnel in this metaphor is completely unknown to me. That aside... Everything is okay, and everything will <em>be</em> okay. The crew are strong. They have proven time and time again that they can rebuild, that they can uphold the true values of Starfleet. They are exemplary officers - their first officer or current CO included - and I could not have asked for better hands to leave this ship in. 

And as for myself? Admittedly, I have no idea what the future holds for me. That odd vision of Denn continues to taunt me within the depths of my dreams. I fear for what the truth may be, if there is any alteration to the current truth at all. Part of me fears finding out – have I antagonised this man for so long for nothing? Is Lieutenant Commander Clark right, that Denn may not have had the strength left to deal with the situation? Perhaps it was me who was wrong, at the end of the day, and not him at all. 

There are times when I am tempted to just give in and end this fight. I was close, before, and this time is no different. It would be far easier than to struggle through all of this. I could set my head down and close my eyes, then become one with the stars around us… But I won’t. It would not be fair on my officers, and it would more than certainly not be fair on the medical staff who have dedicated such time to me. No… I shall do as I did the first time. I will ignore all thoughts of giving in. I have never been one to give up a fight, and so I shall stay stalwart, just like this crew does. 

Everything will be alright, in the end. I have faith the future: of this ship, of this crew. Of myself.</span>

<div class="quote">&quot;I have just had my first meeting with the engineering staff. Overall, I can say that the crew meets my expectations. Although not all of them were present, I plan to forward the information there in to each of their stations so that nothing is missed, and there are no miscommunications. Something that Lieutenant Ferentz was sure to tell me was out of the ordinary. I also had the privilege of witnessing another one of my staff disregard the information in the meeting not even minutes after it had concluded. While their performance has logged above par, I cannot avoid an apprehension with which the staff carries themselves.
</div>&gt; 
<div class="quote">As of now, there is no need to take any sort of corrective action, but I will be mindful of the work ethic and regard for regulation going forward, and respond accordingly. For now, so long as the systems maintain their status and the new equipment is properly integrated, that is my primary focus. I do intend to make contact with other department heads- particularly security. 
</div>&gt; 
<div class="quote">As a final note, I would like to hold an except to the above statements about the engineering crew, and that is Lieutenant Shansa, who has shown a great deal of initiative on her own to maintain the standards of the ship despite the lack of a chief engineer. If anything, she is closer to a commendation than anything. But we will hold off on any official recommendations until I&#39;m certain it was not an anomaly.
</div>&gt; 
<div class="quote">Furthermore, I must express a great deal of confidence in the medical staff. Both Doctor Carlisle and Doctor Clark have shown to be exemplary. If there is a department I can say I have the most confidence in, it would be our Medical wing. After meeting them, I sense that the likelihood of critical injury under ideal circumstances will be minimal.

I&#39;ve stayed upon the Phoenix for what may be a week. I intended to have made reports when I met my staff, but we were temporarily taken away from the Phoenix by the Sentinel. 

The experience was.. trying, to say the least. I was often forced to take charge for tasks that are far out of my experience, forced to watch my people be threatened over and over again because of the mistakes of a few individuals, and when I try to repair these mistakes, it would seeminly fall apart again. 

However, being pessimistic never brought anyone further in their lives. I searched for something good to say about the experience, and I arrived to the conclusion was that I was able to meet the crew. They followed my orders, despite not knowing who I am, or what I stand for, and it was almost... Peaceful, for a time. But, no matter whenever I seeked peace, or quiet, I was interrupted. I cannot remember when I was able to have a full meal before something broke out, or when I was able to get a full night&#39;s sleep, until now, but I was able to help. I met the three tribes, and organized a diplomacy party responsible for putting these tribes at peace, and indirectly allowing us to come home to the Phoenix. It was satisfactory, until I was returned to my post on the bridge.</span>

I am back to isolation. The crew is celebrating their return in different manners, and while many of us worked to get the Phoenix out of the quadrant that had proved to provide an experience no one expected, they have people to return to, to join in the celebrations as we dock onto a space station. I returned to my room, to finally sleep, and to make this log. 

I don&#39;t expect people to run up and talk to me, nor do I expect this isolation to end. I have duties to perform, but on the island, it was nice to be able to forget, for a second, and just swing in a hammock, looking up at the night sky, before having to get up, and deal with the day&#39;s newest problems. 

Of course, finally, I do have a report on the crew I&#39;ve met. Lietenuant Ferentz was a direct cause for much of the difficulties we faced on the island, but I understand, at least a tad, of why he did so. Many people handle stress correctly, and others don&#39;t. He doesn&#39;t. He is currently standing trial as I write this, and all I hope is that he gets a fair verdict, taking in to consideration he is unstable mind when he attacked crew members and superiors.</span>

Lieutenant, Junior, Sara, was John&#39;s former girlfriend. She broke up with him, and under no fault of her own, caused the drama that would plague the camp. There were, of course, better methods to go about this, but under her stressed state of mind, she did well. Ontop of that, she was an effective worker, aiding the camp, and more then making up for the drama that John had caused. I hope she is well, and recovers from her ordeals. 

Lietenuant, Junior, Roode, was the first Tactical I met. She has proved time and time again of her skills and experience, but no one is perfect. She is easy to anger, especially if pain is brought down upon her friends, and while I tried to warn her of the dangers of lashing back against an aggressor, even telling her the story of the Salvatore in hopes of showing her real world examples of what can happen when you think instead of act, but I am unsure of it&#39;s effectiveness. If another event is to occur, however, and she shows the same skills she did during this island escapade, I plan to recommend her for promotion.

Lietenuant Commander Blanche, I have only met briefly, but she has already garnished much of my respect. She is a perfect example of a devoted medical staff, often putting herself at risk in order to help her patients, but I fear that if given the chance, she will sacrifice her life for her patient&#39;s. 

Captain Dunamis is a brilliant Commander, but recent stress has placed him under a tired state. He needs a break, as do all of us. 

My next report will have more in depth about others I&#39;ve met, but hunger has finally won. I must go eat.</span>

The past few days have been... interesting - at once trying, exhausting and above all stressful. To begin with, our mission to simply open diplomatic ties with the residents of the Flageolet system was much, much more than it seemed. The Sentinel, the same entity that once trapped myself and every authority figure on board in a subspace pocket as a twisted form of <em>test</em> of the crew&#39;s basal instincts sought to assess us once again - a test of civility, no less, trapping the entirety of the crew on an uncharted island on the surface of a planet. As expected, emotions ran high upon arrival. Fear. Panic. Anger. Emotions that quickly turned inward, manifesting in arguments and infighting. A fact that continues to at once disappoint and scare me even as I record this log two days on from our experiences. 

The following days were hectic, I suppose one might say - all members of the crew were put to work reforging some semblance of society. Living facilities, gathering food, creating a fire pit by which to cook said food. Granted, a situation not often encountered by Starfleet personnel in this day and age, but I am extremely pleased and proud to report that each and every one of them took to the tasks at hand admirably, some even stepping up to take charge amidst the panic that seemed to accompany the dawn of every single day of our stay. Of note is ensign Walsh - she for one demonstrated beyond doubt that she is braver and stronger than she realizes - a fact that I hope she has since come to terms with. Photons and force fields, flesh and blood. What does it matter? She is a truly valuable and admirable member of the crew, yet another fact I hope she will come to realize in her own time.</span>

Sadly, while certainly there were many positive things learned from our experiences with regards to our adventures on the island, it must also be noted in this commander&#39;s log that there was much lost, too; lost friendship, lost love, lost <em>trust</em> and <em>faith.</em> Tensions ran high throughout, I felt; it does not require empathic abilities to discern at prima facie a scared, panicking crew, amidst the backdrop of our captor&#39;s assessment. There was conflict - some of it physical, but most of it, I felt, emotional. I have learned that the topic of intimate relations arouses the strongest and at times nastiest of emotions; a fact not limited only to humans, as the case certainly was. This combined with the fear, the anger, the confusion long kept repressed in the crew&#39;s minds and hearts... a truly horrifying combination indeed. I only wish that I could do more to quell the waves of emotion that followed. 

Throughout I was reminded starkly of the Terran literary work titled Lord of the Flies, published 1954 - a story of how even young children, when left unchecked, without proper guiding authority and given the right motivation, have the capacity for savagery. Looking back at our circumstances even now I still find parallels; I played the role of Ralph, the leader, the symbol of law and order. That being said, I worried that if there was a Ralph, there would too be a Jack, or worse, a Simon or a Piggy waiting in the wings. I worried that, in spite of our supposedly evolved mentality, evolved sensibilities, in succumbing to our baser instincts we too would discard logic and guiding faith in order to survive - that the crew would tear itself asunder.</span>

Scarier still is the fact that, like Ralph, I too was tempted to succumb at many turns; to join my crew in blaming and yelling; to turn my anger and frustrations inward. Starfleet was in probability light years upon light years away; if we&#39;d truly turned savage, would they be around to see it? Would it matter? Yes, yes, it would have - we would have lost sight of what made us intrinsically us; what made us Starfleet personnel and citizens of the United Federation of Planets. Temptation, fear and power are seductive things indeed; perching on one&#39;s shoulders and chittering in one&#39;s ears like monkeys, whispering honeyed words, empty promises, to get their hapless victim to succumb to their wiles. 

I wonder even now how Sir William Golding would have felt about this had he been with us and still-living. He would be somewhat disappointed, I think. Perhaps even angry. I do not know. If you can read this (and perhaps in some way you might have, having invoked the essence of your greatest work), I ask you, sir, please. Forgive these young men and women so - they were clouded by their basest desires, by fear.</span>

<div class="quote">“If I’m to be completely honest, it’s taken a lot of psychin’ myself up to finally sit down and record this. Commodore Khassid’s passin’ has had a resoundin’ effect on the ship’s entire crew, and understandably, my medical staff in particular; their efforts to preserve her life were exemplary, and I could not be more proud of the department’s performance and efficiency despite all odds. 

Chief Petty Officer Houston’s condition has put us in a difficult situation. I feel as though now, more than ever, the Phoenix’s entire crew need a means of assessin’ their emotions; I know I found some form of solace in beginnin’ to do so. Of course, the officer’s healthy recovery is a priority. Unfortunately, it was this matter that resulted in a rash misjudgement from Doctor sh’Avoness, accordingly dealt with by Doctor Clark and the Captain in my absence. Such a blatant breach of patient confidentiality isn’t a misstep we can afford to let slide, given all that’s goin’ on. 

The kidnappin’ and borgification of a crewmember, for example. In more fortunate news, it appears that Officer d’Patkatol is recoverin’ smoothly from the entire ordeal, which appeared to leave him quite unfazed despite all odds. Cadet Kennox has, to no surprise, maintained his record for stellar direction throughout procedures; I intend to discuss his continued excellence with the Captain once he’s got less on his plate.

Quite frankly, things are startin’ to get busy again. I think it’s necessary, to get back into the swing of things after such a devastatin’ loss. For now, our focus is to provide support with the ship’s ongoin’ efforts on New Romulus. From their contributions so far, and what I’ve witnessed durin’ my short time here, I believe Medical to be more than up to the task.

154384.4

“Okay, so this is my first official work log aboard the Phoenix. So I’ve probably got a lot to say. But I’m just gonna keep it brief, to whom ever reads this, you probably already know of the conflict with the Breen. And if you don’t, you’ve been living under the biggest bolder ever. “

“I’ve treated several patients since I’ve been aboard, but as a nurse there’s only so much I could do. For example the other day a breen was transported to sickbay, all I did was stabilize him. Doctor Veyhz did the actual treating. But that’s okay, as long as he makes it.”

“I feel like I’m some kind of ambassador, because every time the captain or commander call for an away mission or a briefing that involves the breen, I’m always the one attending, but we made a significant break though last night. One that I’m significantly proud of. We’ve taken a right step in our relationship with the Breen.”

“The breen solider in sickbay as far as I know is still in stasis, I told the breen that Doctor V was doing everything he could to treat the man. I mean we’ve got a lot riding on this.”

“It has been… a tense few days. No. That is not quite right. It has been an extremely tense few days; for myself, my senior staff, and my crew. Looking at their faces at all times I see etched upon their expressions their fear, their apprehension, their anger.&quot; 

“Emotions I wish they would never have to feel so acutely in the course of their career. Many of them are freshly minted; bright-eyed, eager, raring to explore the furthest corners of the galaxy they call home and push the frontiers that we, in our infinitely mortal scope, have set for ourselves in our quest. It is my deepest regret that, for some of them, that dream, that vision, might just stay that way - in the most sordid way possible. The losses from this battle shall be great, no doubt; on all fronts. I can only hope that in this dark times, that our foes may find it in themselves to see the light.”

&quot;Regrettably, however, our problems extend not only externally, but internally as well. The good citizens of the Federation have seen for themselves just how far our bureaucracy is willing to go to achieve what it must - and for many more within Starfleet itself, how swift they can be to turn tail and flee when they are needed most. Cruel as it is to say, I mourn the faith that has surely been lost in enduring this ordeal. I mourn for the trust and dignity that may well be lost once our allies in the Khitomer Alliance catch wind of our splintered state.&quot;</span>

“Me and a my away team completed our mission successfully yesterday. What mission that was, I can’t say on log. But we did have compatibility issues in the away team.

Behaviour first noticed when he utilised an explosive device aboard Earth Spacedock whilst rescuing Admiral Nymeria France. Apprehended and confined to the brig. Upon investigation it was discovered he had been taken from the vessel and effectively &#39;brainwashed.&#39; Operatives showed him images of his assimilation, claiming such a thing would not happen under the &#39;Imperium of Worlds.&#39; The Ensign is aware of this event and that his ideals have forcibly be changed. Scans show there has been an alteration to his brain in the production of adrenaline to incite fear and a violent reaction. The Ensign fully remembers these events. He has later attempted to break out and seems to be under pyschological duress. At present he is confined to quarters with replicator access restricted. Different approaches can be utilised if required but it is suggested that his case be referred to a proper psychologist.

Victim Two: Lieutenant Maggie Roode. Signs of Lieutenant Roode&#39;s alteration arose in private with her partner. She became violent with security officers and was confined to the brig. The Lieutenant continually stated that she would change our ideals, fix us, so on and so forth. She appeared to suffer some form of psychological break and continually muttered about whom I have discerned to be her mother. The images shown to her by the officers include abuse at the hands of said mother and how &#39;under the Imperium of Worlds&#39; this would not happen, she would be free to have a safe and happy future, so on and so forth. Scans show there has been an alteration to his brain in the production of adrenaline to incite fear and a violent reaction. Roode also fully remembers being taken and shown these images. The lieutenant later refused to voluntarily escape with Ensign Miller and was stunned by a phaser. She was referred to medical and then discharged and has since been confined to quarters.</div></span>

The Commander was gone from her office and then beamed directly in to the medical bay once more, unconscious. Scans indicated that no change had been conducted and unlike the other two, the Commander does not remember the event at all. At present she is under observation within sickbay.

It would appear that the agents are changing their technique with every person. With Ensign Miller they focussed solely on past events and allowed him to remember the alteration. With Lieutenant Roode they focussed on the past and future to make their ideal seem more tempting - a better attempt on their part. However, they still allowed her to remember. This is highly shoddy work considering how in standard training you are supposed to make the person forget - otherwise, they can rebel. The most logical assumption is that the agents do not have time to carry out their work to the correct standard. Time-jumping continually is likely causing a disintegration effect on them too; utilising smaller shuttles, it would not take long for them to face away. Their time is more limited than ours.

Commander Blanche Carlisle&#39;s case is an intriguing one. Considering how there is no visible change to her mental state whereas there is in the other two, I am led to believe that the operatives did not finish their work or even have time to carry it out in the first place. I cannot, unfortunately, pinpoint a reason for this. I would recommend keeping the Commander under strict observation for the time being. If she begins to start harbouring anti-Federation sentiment then we will know she has been altered but the procedure covered up; something that the agents should technically be doing already.</div></span>

It is my understanding that they are using shuttlecraft in order to travel - these contain technology from a future timeline. I cannot discern more information on this technology for it would endanger our own time period further. I believe they may have the capability to beam directly through a vessel&#39;s shields. I have seen it be conducted before. At present our best option is to catch their shuttlecraft before they can beam out of them. Tachyon and chroniton emissions coming from outwith our ship may help to pinpoint their location as they are likely cloaked. However, if they were to move within our shields, then we would be contained in our own emissions and unable to be localised.

Science, operational, and engineering teams should begin scans and see if they can identify anything. Hopefully they are not using our own shields as a hiding ground but it is a tactic that I am aware of. If they are pinpointed we need to run further investigation on the technology they are using to cloak, time-jump, and beam aboard. The sooner we know what they are doing the sooner we can combat it. 

Security and tactical should work to safeguard those who may be targets along with guarding those already affected. Shipwide patrols would be useful at this time, and all agents should keep tricorders active in order to monitor for tachyons or chronitons within their vicinity. The sooner they are noticed, the better a response time. It is also recommended they keep watch over the status of the ship&#39;s disintegration and evacuate decks if required.</div></span>

I would also like them to keep an eye on the status of the apprehended agent from Earth Spacedock in Admiral France&#39;s time period. If he is to awaken I would like to be informed immediately. Myself and the Intelligence attach&#233;s aboard this vessel shall have to have a conversation with him and see what information we can discern.

<div class="pre pre--multiline nohighlight">Away Mission Report
Stardate: 154581.03
Subject: Hexailos IV, Day Two
Ensign H. Maleb, Tactical Department. Team II

After being briefed by Lt. JG Malcolm Parsons, Team II, consisting of Lt. JG Sara Bj&#248;rge, Ensign T’lith, Ensign Eleanor Davies, and myself, beamed down to the surface of Hexailos IV. We materialized on the ice plains surrounding the base established by Operations and proceeded, as ordered, to the Caverns, after gathering supplies and climbing harnesses. After arriving at the caverns, it was noted that the ‘sludge’ previously seen in the cave had increased in quantity and decreased in viscosity. 
After a scan, Ensign T’lith noted that there was a large number of arthropods present deeper in the cave. With this knowledge, the team continued to cautiously move forward until Ensign Davies accidentally stepped on one such arthropod. It should be noted that Davies was not at fault, seeing as the arthropod was buried in the sludge and we were unfamiliar with the creatures. Lieutenant Bj&#248;rge issued orders for Ensign Davies to slowly back away and for me to take point. I prepared to fire at the creature if ordered to but otherwise did not provoke it. The creature moved away to a new location in the sludge and the team continued moving, this time in a single-file formation, the order being myself, Lieutenant Bj&#248;rge, Ensign T’lith, and finally Ensign Davies. As a precaution, we each tied our harness to the person in front of us and stepped only in the footprints of those ahead.</div></span>

Small amounts of liquid frequently erupted from the ground, but we did not find the cause to these disturbances. After a small amount of time, one arthropod came into the line and attached itself to the leg of Ensign T’lith’s suit. After a small amount of discussion, Ensign Davies applied gentle pressure in an attempt to coax it to move. The creature detached itself and moved away without incident. 
The team had just reached another room of the cave when we received a comms signal from the other team, alerting us to Ensign Nikola Powell’s punctured suit. In response, I contacted the Phoenix and inquired about the transporter window and the possibility of getting aid to the group at the lake. This is when we were informed of an approaching storm and the need for an emergency beam-out. In order to facilitate a transporter lock, the team immediately began moving back to the surface, with Ensign Davies taking point and Ensign T’lith scanning for signs of the storm approaching. As soon as a lock was secured, we were beamed directly to transporter room six, where we were informed of the collapse of the caverns and of Ensign Powell’s injuries. All Team II members were unharmed.</div></span>

<div class="pre pre--multiline nohighlight">[Subject: The Annual Shipwide Physicals Preparations Status]

A team of operations has been formed to cooperate with the medical team. [A list of all those involved so far was inserted here]
The two teams brought these following points, who will need to be reviewed and approved by the COO and/or the ACOO:
-A number of one or two Operations officers per holodeck to assist the Medical officers with the holoprograms
-A announcement to avoid confusion with other departments, or officers, concerning the use of the holodecks
*Medical has not yet provided a schedule for the upcoming physical. It should arrive shortly. 

The Medical team provided the holoprogram that would be used for the physical. The current status of the tests goes as follow:
-A first serie of tests was done. There was no problem encountered.
-A second serie of tests, more demanding, was done. There were a few latencies in the program.
-The latencies were all successfully tested and corrected.
**A third serie of tests has yet to be completed. It will be achieved shortly.

As this report is written, the use of holoprojectors to add a few more temporary holodecks was not yet discussed, tested nor verified. The next report will contain further information about the possibility of this maneuveur.

“Nurse’s log, stardate 154626.5. Sickbay has been more active it seems we’ve received a few more staff; new staff is always good. However, as for my own career, it seems like I’m stuck in a loop. Doing the same thing over and over again. 
I’m more of a doctor nurse than I am a nurse. I’ve been thinking of getting some extra training. I was thinking of becoming a full-fledged doctor. But perhaps that’s something I’ll do in the near future. As for sickbay, the place remains spotless, people organize things four times over. The ship-wide physical seems to be coming together. However, it might be held off for a week or two. Why it’s being held off; you’ll find that info in the tactical log.* </div></span>

&quot;COO&#39;s log, stardate 154637.1. The cargo bays have been rearranged according to a new path optimization algorithm and transporter buffer modifications are going according to plan. The efficiency and behavior of the Operations and Engineering departments has been satisfactory in light of the urgency and nature of the current mission. Though I am new to this vessel, I believe it reasonable to state Engineering in particular, though not my department, should be commended for their efforts and ingenuity. That is of course subjective. The next order of business is to modify the Deck Six transporters to reduce transporter time. In combination with the Deck 
Sixteen transporters&#39; increased buffer capacity, between them they should be optimal for respectively recovering the Q and injured and accommodating large groups of civilians. </div></span>

During the battle a week ago, I attempted to save a man in engineering, his upper body was being crushed by the support beams, the entire engineering was engulfed in flames.

—Foward to Starfleet medical, Fleet admiral Phenna Ephrix—


Hi, this is probably out of the blue, and I know you’ve been pretty busy... but to be honest, you’re the only admiral I really trust with this request; being that you wrote the book on modern-day psychology and pretty much everything medical... Anyways, it’s Amy, you probably don’t even remember me because you were out cold in the cargo bay when we saved you. But I think you were there at my graduation ceremony? I couldn’t really see over the camera flashes, anyways. I wanna become a counselor, I wanna become a counselor because I wanna help people with their mental health; you probably don’t have to run physicals anymore.. but almost <strong>EVERY</strong> person who had come in, has suffered some sort of psychological scaring. And when I try to refer them to a counselor.. there’s never one available. And honestly, I figured why would I want my own problems when I can listen to someone else’s? Believe me, I need something to keep me preoccupied, I wanna do more than just be <em>a nurse.</em> call me back whenever you can.

I also need to talk to Maleb in particular. If he’s to be my XO I should probably get to know him a bit better. There has to be some grit under all that Starfleet. And Verne too. All of them, really. They’re all good officers, each of them just needs a little shove in one way or another. Just like I did. I think ill set up private meetings with each of them to get to know them. Maybe that’ll help. Though, that’ll have to go both ways. We’ll see. End log.</div></span>

- Inventory check - nothing to report, Stardate 154709.4
- Bussard coils - recalibrated Stardate 154709.5
- Elemental grid - inspected Stardate 154709.5- Bussard collector gas canisters at optimal pressure, must be replaced (assuming normal rate of particle collection) by Stardate 154747.0
- Induction coil assembly (spare) relocated from lower warp core storage area to cargo bay Stardate 154747.2
- Auxiliary power failure simulation conducted Stardate 154717.2. Findings contained in supplementary report T&#39;Svai-6-Bravo on Operations Hub and Engineering Hub consoles
- Request for feedback sent out to all members of department Stardate 154717.3.
- Personal note: determined universal translator has a good enough grasp of nuance to know when to not translate words from time to time. Contact a communications officer for explanation if time allows.

Summary: All systems nominal.

However, after contacting Starfleet medical, they informed me that this was an uncommon condition, but not life-threatening.

Report: 
For the last few weeks we have been Stationed at ESD held in the Earth Reserve Fleet until, U.S.S. Pheonix, NCC-93472  is given orders. Engineering has run diagnostic tests on all the major and minor systems which have all proven the systems are running at optimal levels. 

Engineering Morale:

The Engineering team&#39;s morale seems to be intact. This time spent at Earth has encouraged some of the Engineering officers to pursue extracurricular Engineering interests Ensign Miller has finished an Android he has named Alice, she is learning and adapting quickly to her surroundings. As Ensign Aaron is technically a new father according to Starfleet charter he will be offered an opportunity to take paternity leave to nurture the new being that he has created.
Note: The systems are in good condition though considering we are docked with ESD this is to be expected.

We currently are fully prepared for launch. All tactical Systems are fully prepared and ready. Going though the list. Phasers are operating at full power. The upgrades I initiated into our phasers are also working fine. Torpedos are stocked and ready for battle, the torpedo bays are also in good condition. The tactical hub and the rest of deck 3 are fully repaired after the events of New Romulus,  I have yet to discover any errors with the machinery nor have any been reported. We are fully stocked on phasers, phaser rifles, various grenades and any miscellaneous equipment we would keep in the armoury.  Personnel are all operating efficiently, Lieutenant Junior Grade Maleb and Ensign Deimora Byrne especially.

I’m just.. working up the courage. But I’ve been informed I have an office on deck 7? I’ll have to check that out tomorrow, I’ve never been on that deck so it’ll be a bit of a field trip for me.</div>

MCPO. Eshen’strars Houston, Counsellor
Ensign Deimora Byrne, Stardate 98370.18

Terms and Conditions of Therapy

1. I am bound by the Codes of Ethics and Practice of Starfleet Psychosocial Support. A copy of this code of practice can be found [here]. 
2. As per our consultation that you would benefit from EMDR, I agree to offer you an initial six sessions. You are not contracted to any specific number of sessions and this may be increased if we believe this would assist you. You may terminate these sessions at any time if you so wish. 
3. The duration of each session will be one hour. This time may be altered in future. If you are late for a session then I shall see you for the remainder of the duration but will not be able to work beyond the allotted time.
4. It is understood that sometimes sudden events such as red alerts or away missions might result in you having to cancel at the last minute or not attend without notification. If you can give me contact that you need to drop out of a session then it is appreciated. 
5. As part of my code of practice I am required to carry out continuing professional development including regular clinical supervision. This may result in me discussing your case with a colleague, but I will never relay any confidential information or utilise any identifying details.
6. Confidentiality will be maintained within the code of ethics and all legal requirements. The only time that I will not uphold this vow of confidentiality is if I would be breaking the law by withholding information from the relevant authorities. If there is ever a time in which It is required that I break confidentiality – for example, if there was a risk to the wellbeing of yourself or others and I had to refer your case to somebody else – then you would be consulted first.</div></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace"><div class="pre pre--multiline nohighlight">7. Our therapeutic relationship will remain professional at all times. For example I will not initiate physical contact with you. I see you around the ship I shall treat you like any other crewmember and offer a smile, nod, etc. After our sessions have come to a close these professional boundaries may remain in place and the confidentiality of your case will be upheld indefinitely. 
8. If I ever need to get in touch with you then I shall use the starship directory. If you need to contact me then you can do the same. Please note that I may not answer out with my standard shift pattern. As per policy for starship counsellors you are capable of stopping by for a standard talk outside of these planned sessions. I am also available on call as part of the crisis team on certain days of the week.
9. Notes on your file are held in accordance with Starfleet’s Data Protection Act. These are securely stored on your personnel file and only available to be accessed by an authorised medical officer. If you would like a copy of these notes then you are entitled to a copy at any time.
10. I will not terminate our contract without warning except in exceptional circumstances, such as due to sudden transfer or medical emergency. Please note that any form of threats or violence will invalidate this agreement and the therapy will cease. A session may not take place if you arrive under the influence of alcohol or non-prescribed drugs – this would remain to my discretion. 
11. EMDR can be demanding, frustrating, and emotional. This process can be very difficult and you may feel the need to end the therapy at some stage. If this occurs then your feedback will be requested and forwarded to Psychosocial for further analysis. It would be appreciated if you raise this with myself or a college of mine first so we can work together to resolve these issues. If required you are also invited to take a case to the Starfleet Psychosocial Support Network.</div></span>

Report:
For the last week, most of my work has been repairing and refining some key systems. I noticed that the fire supressions systems had been in constant use ever since our last stop at ESD. I have raised the FSS&#39;s efficiency by 13.6 %, 2 percent better than the last checkup. The rest of the systems were operational, including the turbolift controls. I have noticed that they have been kept tidy, even though they have been constantly used. Overall, everything is operational, the ship has never been in better care.

<div class="pre pre--multiline nohighlight"> An incident that occurred yesterday in mess hall at 1600 hours was notified to me today by Lt. Commander Amanda Higgins that Ensign Charlie Akron (Science Department) had &quot;An emotional outburst.&quot; and that &quot;He threw some kind if old school radio at a wall and shattered it.&quot;
I have spoken with the ensign and have decided that it was a small enough incident that no punishment needed to be delivered, only a talk of meditation, self-soothing and guidance towards our counselors in general, as well as should a similar incident happen in the future. I will be keeping updates on the Ensign and regular check-ins as a preventative measure for future outbursts.

Summary: 
An away team consisting of the above individuals beamed down to the planet in response to a distress call with standard seismological equipment. [See attached list.] Away team set up equipment. Away team became aware of two local life-forms nearby. [See: Addendum, Species Characteristics] Life-forms attempted test of a rudimentary rocket design. The rocket burnt up in the atmosphere and ignited the surrounding grass. Surrounding foliage was dry and ignited quickly, and was thereby determined to pose an imminent threat to the away team, equipment, and mission objective. After consulting with the bridge, the away team attempted to put out the fire. In the process, the away team was unavoidably seen by the two life-forms. The USS Phoenix then sent a shuttlecraft to put out the rest of the fire. The shuttlecraft was seen by the two life-forms and, according to them, the nearby settlement. The two life-forms were removed from the fire and given medical attention. The away team divulged their identity and place of origin and attempted to obtain information about the species themselves and nature of the distress call. [See: Addendum, Distress Call] The away team then returned to the USS Phoenix.</div></span>

Per a life-form named Ibn&#39;nahiir, the rocket test seen by the away team was being performed in order to alert any nearby extraterrestrials to the imminent threat of increased tectonic activity. This tectonic activity destroys the Saladin species&#39; civilization and technology every twenty years. It does not affect the Baharien or Mlimari. The Usaniir wished to prevent such a catastrophe from recurring. Seismological data indicates a volcanic eruption is likely to occur three days from first contact time.</div>

Stardate: 154802.4

<div class="pre pre--multiline nohighlight"> A meeting was held to discuss schedule changes, task delegation, and recent personnel changes Stardate 154790.4. Updated schedule is attached. Updated task assignments are attached. At the time of the meeting, Lt. Cmdr. T&#39;Svai was on sick leave, and the meeting minutes reflect that she was removed from the schedule. This is no longer the case, and so at the time of writing she has been added back to Beta shift. The schedule has been re-altered to reflect this.

In response to discussion had during the Senior Staff meeting, Operations will be in contact with Science in order to discuss if any interdepartment collaboration is needed. 

Recent repairs completed: bussard collector canister replacement, autoscheduler recoding.</div></span>

…Where do I begin?

I guess I’ll have to split this log into sections. Things have been all-go from the start. It would have been nice to get a chance to settle in and actually get things sorted before everything kicked off, y’know?
 
Never mind. 

Coming aboard was alright, first impressions of the crew are decent enough. One thing I’ve noticed is the lack of – y’know – tradition. No one was waiting for my group and I at the transporter room and it was only when we were halfway down the corridor that the XO showed up. He’s… An interesting sort. Now I’ve read his file, of course, know about some of the stuff that’s happened. But it’s almost like he exudes negativity. I had a bit of a talk with him, told him I want us working together seamlessly and that if he’s gonna put that negativity onto the crew then I ain’t going to tolerate it. 

Staff meeting was fair enough, other than butting heads with a couple of folk. It’s not something that I want to do, you know? I don’t want to go around telling them off and changing their way of working. But it seems like they’ve had a… Very hands-off approach to this place being run. It’d be all fair and well if things were working fine that way, but they’re not. 

Tactical has some sort of programme to train a new ACTO despite already having one. I’ve spoken to them about that, caught them at the end of one of their training scenarios. The existing ACTO is the one training the new ACTO – bit weird considering her lack of experience and how the programme should be done by the CTO themselves. It seems like they’ve just been running bridge training even though the officer isn’t going to be in charge of the bridge. I’ve… Read logs about their CTO. Think I need to spend some more time with the woman before I can properly make a judgement, but there’s something about the attitude that I just don’t like.&quot;</div></span>

I’ve read over notes and their CSO seems to be doing pretty well considering how at the start of the year she wasn’t even an ACSO. Honestly, I question the decisions of the former captains of this ship, but if things are working fine then I’m not going to complain. The Lieutenant said that she’s fine handling the place by herself but I’d like to find her someone to take up the assistant position soon. It ain’t exactly fair if everything is put upon her, but like I say, she’s been handling it all well so far. 

Medical seems to be run by some Lieutenant Junior Grade instead of its CMO and ACMO, although the latter is new. The dedication of the Lieutenant in question is definitely appreciated but it’s made me wonder why exactly she thinks she has to submit a log every day. A patient report form after patching someone up would be fine, but doing a standard log of goings on? It’s a weekly task, not a daily one, and why is it being done by her? Strange.

The Chief Operations Officer is another person who I butted heads with a bit. I think it’s all been handled now, but… Ugh, it was just confusing. One second the woman is saying that she’s off-duty and the next she’s saying she’s still on duty. There was a whole sort of palaver behind it and I didn’t really need the “I died and came back to life” explanation, literally just some clarification. Judging from previous information she’s dedicated to her work, knows to hold meetings and keep up with the rest of the department, just… I dunno. Maybe it’s our personalities that are clashing. It happened with this away mission as well – but that’s another story in itself.”</div></span>

They’ve got a dedicated CEO and ACEO working together well, everything seems on track and it doesn’t seem like they’ve had many issues recently. I’m pretty impressed by their performance – and by their projects. There’s some Ensign down there who straight-up built himself an Android, everybody seems to be working on something or another. They’re holding meetings, keeping up to date with one another. Definitely not a problem there at all. 

Security is… Dead, the poor folk. Seems as if they haven’t had anything to do since some strange string of murders a while back. The CoS seems to be dedicated enough, although maybe a little bit lacking in terms of initiative. Run some emergency preparedness drills! It’s obvious (again from this bloody distress call incident) that they could be doing with the training. There’s a Cadet that needs training as well, saw them on the list. Just… Do something, run training, that sort of thing. Suppose it might make it a bit easier when I manage to find them an ACoS. 

And with that in mind – Intelligence. Those lot don’t have anyone to report back to aboard the ship and I don’t think their leadership checks in too often. They’re left to their own devices which is fine, but they need to be integrated more. It’s with that in mind that I had a chat with Commander Ch’evhalen about integrating them into Security. The two go hand-in-hand at the end of the day. I’d like one of those kids to become the ACoS. Both Lieutenant Junior Grade K&#246;nig and Ensign King – don’t their surnames mean the same thing? Wait, tangent – seem to be good candidates. I’ll have to observe some of their work out in the field and see how they do before coming to a decision.&quot;</div></span>

They’ve got a representative down there and they haven’t had any issues, and if they do it gets fed to them and then passed onto the boatswain. Seems like the crewmen and NCOs largely handle all of that sort of thing. They’re all doing fine as well, checked in with the boatswain about any concerns. It’s quite nice to hear that the senior staff haven’t been picking on the non-commissioned folk. It’s something you see way too often aboard other ships. The Phoenix might be un-organised but at least its crew are nice. 

Disorganisation still needs fixed, though, and so that’s what I’m going to do. At present the third officer is listed as Commander Blanche Carlisle – the CMO – but she’s busy down in Medical and barely has any bridge training. I think I’m going to distribute that to somebody else. Second Officer isn’t filled either, so I’ll be looking over candidates for that soon too. I just wish that somebody had sorted this sort of thing out sooner. It would be saving me one heck of a lot of hassle. 

Now… Onto this away mission thing. Should I create a separate log for that? Awh, screw it, it’s all going to be recorded in the same place anyway. 

We had the ship on standard patrols when we picked up some sort of old radio signal. Proper old frequency, I’ve heard radio historians talk about it. We managed to track it back to this planet that I think we’ve identified as Gramen. M-Class, little bit different from Earth, but nothing too out of whack. Distress call said that they were experiencing some sort of seismic event and fair enough, our scans both from the ship and on the ground seem to indicate that they might be on the way to some sort of tectonic plate movement. Fair enough that they would want some help – only issue is that they ain’t warp capable.&quot;</div></span>

The Prime Directive – obviously – states that we can’t interfere as a result. However, they were the ones who asked for our help. They clearly knew that some sort of other being was out there. It wouldn’t exactly be fair of us to just ditch them without assistance. 

On Lieutenant K&#246;nig’s suggestion a team was sent down to do some research and monitor any seismological shifts or whatever you want to call it. Tectonic movement, volcano, uh, build up. Whatever. During this they caught sight of two natives; plant-like folk who seem bipedal, humanoid, but green-skinned and patterned with leaves and thorns. These two seemed to be trying to launch some sort of rocket. The short of it is that their rocket failed, came crashing down, and ended up setting one heck of a lot of their countryside on fire. 

The away team stayed put while all of this was going down, although it was quite obvious that they were getting techy. Nobody wants to watch folk- watch folk b- …watch that sort of thing. But at the same time they were also hellbent upon following the Prime Directive. I’m not sure if that’s been instilled into them from some other CO or what, and they’re happy to complain about my ruling if they’re properly invested in it, but it’s something that I’m not going to follow. Every CO knows that rules are made to be broken, and the Prime Directive is the biggest (and stupidest, at times) rule of them all. There’s no way in Hell that I was going to let them sit back and watch.&quot;</div></span>

They all made it out okay and took the civilians out with them. I had engineering alter one of the shuttlecraft and modify it with fire-suppressant foam – I had expected them to open the hatch and pour it from the shuttle’s cargo bay but instead the engineering team actually altered it to be controlled through their weapons system. Pretty bloody good work – and I’m tempted to keep that shuttlecraft as a designated response-craft and just requisition another for standard use. I mean… This is another problem in itself. Why didn’t they have this sort of thing standing by? I dread to think about their fire response onboard the ship. 

Anyway. I didn’t hear a lot of the conversation but it seems like the away team have gathered quite a bit of information. I’m yet to debrief the team but I’ll learn more then – but so far, comms traffic and a log by the COO will do. She seems good at writing those. 

That rocket launch was an attempt to signal us and say that their people still needed our help even when their message had stopped playing (their radios weren’t strong enough to keep transmitting over that distance.) They’re friendly, thankfully, and they do genuinely need our help. Every twenty or so years it seems like they undergo tectonic shifts and their society is completely wrecked by natural disasters. They’ve gotten a bit fed up of having to rebuild over the years. 

They’ve invited us to stay down on their planet for a while and co-ordinate with their scientists, apparently their ‘elders’ won’t mind too much. I’m thinking that after a second meeting with them to iron out some details of how we can help that might be a viable option. The place seems nice, they’re not hostile, and I’m sure the crew would appreciate some time down there. Gramen does seem serene.&quot;</div></span>

It’s been mentioned by these people that they have two other dominant sentient species living on their planet. The Baharien are folk who live up in the mountains and apparently worship the volcano. The Mlimari are supposedly hostile and live within the ocean. These two can’t be warp capable either, and sound to be lesser-developed than our contacts, the Usaniir. If we’re gong to try to solve their natural disaster issue then we’re going to have to consult the other two species first – especially if one views this volcano as a crucial aspect to their religion. I think it might be worth talking to our contacts and getting more information first.

And something else that I want looked into – those strange energy sources that we picked up on the map when we did our initial scans. Do the inhabitants of the planet know about that? On our scans it seems like natural geothermal energy but just highly condensed. I’d like to hope it isn’t something malicious, but I want to be certain. I want to go ahead and send folk down there so they can work or relax or both or whatever. But at the same time, I want to ensure they’re safe. 

…Ugh. It’s one heck of a to-do list. It’ll get done, I’m just cautious of this Gramen issue being time-sensitive. Okay. So. ACoS, 2O, 3O, speak with the Usaniir, send a team to the Mlimari, send a team to the Baharien, have another working on a fix for the natural disasters. Research more into those four strange energy sources… I want to look into promotions too at some point, check out those who might be ready for one… Oh – and I need to call Command. They’ll want to know about another first contact and/or break in their Prime Directive. Not that they’ll care. I’m pretty sure they stop caring after the first five times they hear about a ship doing that. 

Alright. Is that everything? I think so.

Summary: EV suit checks and shuttle diagnostics completed before shuttle departure. Shuttle (U.S.S. Magellan) landed on Gramen, near Baharien settlement, adjacent to volcano. Away team encountered several Baharien life forms, who briefly had a disagreement concerning the nature of the mission (i.e., freezing part of the volcano.) The misunderstanding was cleared up. A hole was drilled into the side of the volcano to create an alternate route for lava flow. Away team was carried down the volcano interior to the desired cryodevice placement point by a Baharien, Uhx&#39;Ameks. The cryodevice was placed and primed. The away team returned to the shuttle landing site and activated the cryodevice. The volcano interior was changed to the desired effect, redirecting lava flow towards the new hole and thus preventing it from flowing towards the Usaniir settlement Away team returned to Phoenix with full complement. No incidents reported save for exposure to unusual levels of heat.</div></span>

Summary: Away team beamed down to location adjacent to archaeological dig site, then beamed over Usaniir Ibn&#39;nahiir (at their request) for assistance in navigating the site. Encountered Usaniir Dhalt&#39;irs [See Addendum: Species Notes -Usaniir, Supplemental]. Dhalt&#39;irs informed the away team two of their colleagues had gone missing. Away team contacted Phoenix to detect matching life signs, corpses. Away team was led to main dig site, where they were shown bones of a theorized precursor species. Tricorder dating placed them at ~400 years old. [See Addendum: Species Notes - Nonbarafu/Precursor] Dhalt&#39;irs informed away team the tectonic aberrations had begun ~300 years prior. The team was also guided to blue ice sculptures with highly regular architecture, dated around the same time period. At this time the away team received news that the two missing Usaniir were deceased, and informed Dhalt&#39;irs of this fact. They became distressed. Several away team members [See * markings on personnel list] reached for their phasers. Away team was nonverbally urged to stand down. 

Away team and Dhalt&#39;irs beamed 500 meters from the nearby geothermal energy pocket site. The team proceeded to the site and took tricorder readings. Three life-forms approached the site. They provided the information contained in Addendum: Species Notes - Nonbarafu/Precursor. I attempted to phaser a hole above the  geothermal pocket site, and was soon accompanied by Ensign Akron, for unclear reasons. The new life-forms directed us to cease. We did so. Ensign Akron pulled a phaser on the life-forms. Several crew members [See + marks, personnel list] vocally disapproved. The newcomers departed. The away team returned to the Phoenix.</div></span>

<div class="pre pre--multiline nohighlight">Addendum: Species Notes - Nonbarafu/Precursor

Per Nonbarafu, they are caretakers of Gramen. At one point ~400 years ago some members of their species entered the volcano and underwent &#39;transcendence&#39;, akin to metamorphosis, giving them wings and unspecified abilities. Their objective is to prevent other species of Gramen from undergoing the same process, which they perceive as painful. Species was hostile, defensive, and unfriendly towards Usaniir present (Dhlat&#39;irs). Anatomy matches precursor bones found at dig site. Species verbally confirmed correlation.

Per Nonbarafu, the unusual geothermal readings are a natural occurrence. Different species are attracted to different sites, and upon exposure undergo transcendence. Mechanism unknown. All readings return pure geothermal energy, even through discontinuities in ice.</div></span>

<div class="quote">Summary: Upon arrival, met with Usaniir representative and spoke about options re: transcendence. Initial apprehension by Usaniir rep. assuaged by Usanirr Elder Lepido who stated the majority of the Usaniir deisred to undergo the Trascendence. I divided the crew into three away teams and ordered the other two teams to make contact with the Baharien and Mlimari respectively, and to assist with the Transcendence if asked. Teams kept in regular contact and aided all the species in making it safely to their respective areas. I lead away team two into the icy wilderness to the research camp and were met by researcher Ibn&#39;nahiir, who expressed reservations about the Transcendence and opted to stay behind. As the Transcendence took place, tectonic activity increased many fold and the Usaniir seemingly froze in suspended animation, despite there being no lifesigns present. Similar experiences were reported from the other two away teams. As tectonic activity increased, all away teams were beamed back aboard the Phoenix.

Captain’s Log, Stardate 154832.8. 

Do I… Do I really have to do one of these? I mean – I’ve already submitted all of the formal reports to Starfleet Sciences and Command alike. I’ve compiled everything together, all of those analyses and away team documents and… Everything. It’s all been passed on anyway. I just – spirits, I don’t know how to explain any of this. 

So the last time I made one of these, what had I covered? That the Usaniir had summoned us to their planet using their old radios, tried to use a rocket as a flare, that sort of thing. Well… Needless to say, things kicked off. It turned out that there were two other species living down there on that planet, the Baharien and Mlimari. Neither were warp capable as well so it left us in that predicament once again. I got in touch with Science, considering how we had already told the Usaniir we would help and they were aware of our existence by this stage. By some miracle they gave us authorisation to speak with the other two species to explain that we were going to try to save their planet from those natural disasters. Honestly? Might have been easier if Science had just said no.

It’s been away team after away team for over a week. Folk went down there to meet the Baharien. Turns out they actually worship that volcano so instead of freezing the tectonic plates beneath it we had to come up with some plan to re-direct the magma flow or… However that’s meant to be scientifically explained. The Mlimari – hostile, weird fish folk – got pretty hostile until the crew were forced to fire a phaser at them. Normally I’d be wary considering how this was a first contact but it was in self defence. I can’t really complain.&quot;</div></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace"><div class="pre pre--multiline language-bash">&quot;I’m… Condensing information quite a lot here. We got a consultant geologist out to help us with all of these plans. An away team went down into the depths of the sea of all things to plant this device to try to freeze together two of the tectonic plates, but then they found out that there was some sort of device down there. At the time we didn’t know what it was for. Turns out that thing was creating this tectonic plate movement, not trying to stop it. Basically the device didn’t work. 

Team at the volcano had more luck at least. They managed to redirect that lava flow perfectly fine and the Baharien seemed perfectly fine with it. Then there was a whole thing with an archaeological dig site while we tried to work out where that machinery came from, and then this fourth species turned up. These folk, called the Nonbarafu, had actually been ‘guarding’ over the planet for however many years. I mean – they say guarding, but it wasn’t a good guarding. They were purposefully trying to hold back the others so they didn’t catch up in terms of technology or… In terms of evolution, I suppose. 

That’s what those four energy sources turned out to be – places that triggered the evolution of these species. The Nonbarafu had undertaken it ages ago by travelling from their ice caps to the volcano. We found out about it, the Nonbarafu decided to cause Hell by telling the other species about it, and TLDR they decided to undertake the process despite it being stupidly dangerous. Naturally we were going to give a hand. We had gotten into this mess with them and we weren’t just going to ditch them now.&quot;</div></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace"><div class="pre pre--multiline language-bash">&quot;It… Created a lot of trouble, though. Or at least, we thought it was trouble. We had theorised that it all might be a trap. The Usaniir froze over. The Baharien sunk. The Mlimari just… Went still. And then the planet fuckin’ – I know I’m not supposed to swear in these, but screw it. The planet shattered. Split into four parts, and then those four parts slowly froze over until they were encased in ice. 

And I mean… What were we supposed to think? We thought that they were all dead. We thought we had just watched a triple-genocide; one that we had basically caused because we decided to get involved despite the Prime Directive. Kind of made me remember why exactly the thing exists. Everyone was… The crew wasn’t in a good way. I sent them all off-duty and ran the bridge with a skeleton crew, myself, Commander Dunamis, and Commodore Khassid. It worked alright. Just wish I could have given the two of them a break as well. 

I was ready to report into Science and tell them that I had screwed up when things kicked off again, almost 36 hours later, I’d wager to say. I mean, I’ll still have to report in, but… You know what I’ll mean. Planet thawed out. The three species had undertaken their evolution. They can fly, now. Survive in space, don’t need to breathe while in that state. I think that must have been what our cryptic Q clue was about – being held back against the tide or whatever it was. Holding them back was the Nonbarafu and the tide was their evolution trying to call to them.&quot;</div></span>

I didn’t think I’d ever witness such a thing – or feel such guilt when we thought that they were dead. And I guess the guilt is going to stay here for a while, because I’m going to do what every captain does and I’m going to think about what ifs. ‘What if they hadn’t thawed out,’ ‘what if that had been on me?’ It’s still on me, I mean. I’m still going to have to face Science. But it just… It could have been a lot worse. 


But you know what, on the other hand? We helped. We helped them through it all. We warded off the Nonbarafu after one final conversation. The Diplomatic Corps are out there now and they’re going to try to help Gramen get settled. They can exist in space now by themselves so we don’t need to think about warp capability, we’re all good now that’s all over. We helped them. We basically freed them from the clutches of some evil folk trying to hold them back. So…

Yes, I did wrong. Yes, I screwed up, and it could have caused the genocide of three distinct species. But it’s just something I’m going to have to deal with, isn’t it? And it’ll be fine, surely. Science will do their usual slap on the wrist and tell me to not be an idiot. But at the end of the day… They authorised it. We did good, not bad. And that’s what I’m going to focus on, because it’s what I would want the crew to focus on as well. Positive not negative, alright? 
Yeah. 

Computer?

Other Notes: Ensign Lithop Howard is due for bridge training, and has finally been assigned a time to do so by Commander Dunamis. [Stardate 154835.6] Furthermore, Ensign Alexander Philips has requested bridge training as well and I would like to see if scheduling both ensigns in the same day would be possible and/or feasible. A report is due on Gramen and due to the sickness that I was afflicted with during that mission, I am unfortunately a bit behind- but will remedy by taking report from the officers who attended in order to give a proper log and file of the event.

Additional notes: 

Located unknown organisms intentionally released by science officer in Jefferies tube OM14-Gamma, Stardate 154856.17. Sealed off area and procured specimen. Took specimen to sickbay to scan for anomalous pathogens, as Jefferies tube lacks biofilters at entry and exit points. ACMO recommended taking the specimen to Science instead for analysis, and did not endorse this course of action on the basis that essential resources were unnecessarily diverted. Temporary junction closure alert sent to Engineering and Operations. CSO informed. Junction has since been reopened. </div></span>

Subject: System Test

<div class="pre pre--multiline nohighlight">I have attempted to create a new category of Tactical Department leadership logs for the purpose of familiarizing myself with the process of creating such logs. Although I technically do not have permission to do this, I was told to &quot;study&quot;. I believe that this is a vital part of studying that I will not have the opportunity to explore with assistance from others.
Seeing as we do not currently have a Chief Tactical Officer, I expect that it will be necessary to work to keep the department cohesive and unified, and to maintain communication and ensure all tasks are covered. Although I do not know what this work will entail, I will contribute as much to is as possible.</div>

Stardate: 154861.59

Subject: Bi-Daily Log, Part 1

<div class="pre pre--multiline nohighlight">I have decided that I will organize my logs into three sections. The first will focus on the affairs of the Department as a whole, the next on my personal work, and the final on the progression of my training. I believe that it will allow me to ensure that I cover all necessary topics efficiently and effectively.

DEPARTMENT AFFAIRS
- Shielding and Aiming Algorithm, Ensign Deimora Byrne
    Ensign Byrne is currently working on creating an aiming algorithm, alongside a shielding algorithm. I have not yet inquired about the details of this, but there is a chance that it is quite similar to the algorithm that I developed several months ago. I have asked her to review my work, as it is logical to believe that she may learn from it to improve her own program. 
- Tactical Department Dinner, Ensign Eleanor Davies
    At Lieutenant Verne’s request, I have contacted Ensign Davies about her interest in hosting a Tactical Department Dinner and am currently awaiting a response. It is our hope that it will serve as an opportunity to strengthen intradepartment bonds and ensure that there are no cohesion issues as a result of lacking a CTO.</div></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace"><div class="pre pre--multiline nohighlight">PERSONAL WORK LOG
- Completed Tasks
    -- Discussed aiming algorithm with Ensign Byrne. I will message her for more information at a later time. 
    -- Discussed department leadership with Lieutenant Verne. This conversation was somewhat confusing. I gathered that Lieutenant Verne intends to run department training and will forward me any reports that she receives, so that I may read them. I also believe that it would be wise for me to “check-in” with the officers who work in the armoury, to ensure that it is properly stocked. 
    -- Messaged Ensign Davies. See “Department Affairs”.
- CTATS
    As usual, I performed maintenance on CTATS. It consisted of checking for any errors that have arisen while the program automatically entered public mission reports into its database; a total of 396 errors were found due to slight changes in the public registry. They were easily fixed.
- Phaser realignment
There were slight misalignments in phaser array seven. They have been corrected.

TRAINING LOG
- Earlier, Lieutenant Verne ran a holodeck training simulation with me. It consisted of a raid on a Tal Shiar base. Aside from the diplomatic implications of such a program, it was a standard away mission, not unlike one that can be run in CTATS.
- According to Lieutenant Verne, the department&#39;s loss of our CTO will be a good training opportunity, as unfortunate as it is. It should provide leadership opportunities.</div>

Met several members of the team, including a lieutenant who was able to provide me with some information on how the department was previously run. I will request a meeting with the captain tomorrow to discuss a few ideas I have for the team, including running emergency preparedness drills, holosuite simulations, and hosting team activities.

Further Notes:

As per the request of Commander Ch&#39;evhalen, I have reviewed notes on ocular implants as a means of visual augmentation. The procedure is one I am familiar with, and have successfully performed a number of times in the past. My only concern, therefore, approaching the implants is the adjustment period that follows — the Commander assures me he is prepared to go through with it nonetheless. Coincidentally, Ensign T&#39;Skyiar who is proficient in the field of prostheses expressed great interest in any related opportunities. As such, I plan to inform her of the procedure&#39;s planning and encourage her participation.</div></span>

Log streak: 53

“The captain was beamed into sickbay hours ago. With *very* extensive wounds. Not normal things either, dislocated bones, electrical burns. Hell, a *slit* throat. It was the most unsettling thing I’ve ever seen in my career. But Lieutenant Zulola, Ensign Ciel and I were on her already. First we got on scans and stopping the blood. We had to move her to the surgical bay with how she was looking. I removed the blade that was sticking out of her stomach; it’s already been turned over to security. After clearing the blood, I stitched her up. Then she fell into VFIB, I immediately ordered cortical stimulation, we shocked her three times before she was back to normal heart rate. Then we kept working. Ciel performed the removal on the Larynx; and I put the new one in. And the electrical impulses to her brain was.. horrible. Honestly I was surprised she wasn’t brain dead by the way those shocks were looking. But Lola, was already on it repairing the cosmetic and internal damage. We most certainly aren’t out of the woods, the captain is still on pulmonary support. I doubt she’ll be awake to talk anytime soon.” </div></span>

Report: All areas of the Science department are running at full functionality for the exception of the taxonomy labs replicator. 

Other Notes: Earlier this week, plans were finally made to build the toxic plant life enclosure since there was seemingly a good bit of time before we had a mission on the forefront. Unfortunately, during the initial set up with Lt. Commander T&#39;Svai, the Lt. Commander suffered a mild allergic reaction to an Acamarian Viperbush which is, unfortunately, poisonous to Vulcans under specific circumstances. However, she was thankfully only mildly affected and a report was filed with medical about her condition- which has improved. 
Two days later, I was gifted the help of Ensign Akron and Lt. M. Verne with taking toxic plants out of the isolation cove and into the arboretum proper to be sorted and placed appropriately. Due to the allergy scare with Lt. Commander T&#39;Svai and paired with Ensign Akron&#39;s Vulcan heritage, I ensured that all persons inside the arboretum to wear a filter suit while working. Unfortunately, the replicator in my office malfunctioned, and Ensign Akron was also affected by the Acamarian Viperbush resulting in another, thankfully mild, allergic reaction. 
After both instances, I ensured that all persons left the arboretum, and I finished the project myself to ensure no more mishaps would occur. 
I&#39;m happy to report that both Ensign Akron and Lt. Commander T&#39;Svai have made full recoveries and that the Acamarian Viperbush is behind a sealed barrier and will no longer contribute to any reactions to the ships Vulcan population. 

The next day, I contacted Lt. Commander Higgins about looking into why the replicator in the arboretum office malfunctioned, to which she reported after the inspection that the replicator was &quot;old and should be out of service.&quot; A new replicator will be installed by today, therefore nullifying anymore malfunctions.

A spatial anomaly was spotted above an Unknown Planet today at 0700, due to said spatial anomaly, the USS Phoenix was dragged close, unfortunately causing disrepair to our engines. Deciding to investigate the planet and the anomaly that surrounded it, an away team was sent down on-planet to investigate.
Persons included in the away team were Lt. Lokath Targesh, Lt. Rekat Parlac, Lt. Maggie Verne, Lt. Sara Bj&#248;rge (myself) Lt. JG. Haitek Maleb, Lt. JG. Zulola Jex, Ensign Ciel, Ensign Lithop Howard, Ensign Kytha Briar, and Crewman Brom Stique.

On our initial few minutes having beamed down on planet, we were inundated with an emergency situation as we attempted to find higher ground out of the grasslands we&#39;d found ourselves in. A bear-like creature roughly 14 to 15 feet at the withers immediately attacked the away party, initially attacking Crewman Stique, flinging him into the underbrush and then heading for Ensign Ciel, but was saved by Lt. Targesh, though by sacrificing himself to serious injury. Both Crewman Stique and Lt. Targesh were beamed to medical as swiftly as was possible considering the dire situation, but unfortunately Crewman Stique did not survive his injuries.
The bear-like creature was promptly euthanized by phaser fire and the away party retreated to higher ground.</div></span>

<div class="pre pre--multiline nohighlight">Upon getting to higher ground, we were met with a female humanoid being, giving the name &quot;Ishara&quot; to us as we too introduced ourselves to her, unable to escape the interaction. As it was explained to us- The civilization that inhabits the planet are multi-generational hybrids of Vulcans and Humans. They had allegedly arrived on the planet some 400 to possibly 500 years ago. During this time, they have been having incidents with a being only known as &quot;Beasts&quot; and seem to have a deep fear of them, even though the &quot;Beasts&quot; have never been actually seen, but are allegedly known to have purple blood.
We were introduced to the leader of these people, a male humanoid by the name of &quot;R&#39;Hen&quot; and given these details in exchange for seeing the color of our own blood and ensuring that we didn&#39;t have the purple blood of the &quot;Beasts.&quot; Talks were tense and while we gained a wealth of knowledge about this new society, we were under prepared to make first contact and recommend sending on the next mission not only more armed personnel, but to also bring along First Contact Specialists- as seemingly, they have known of Earth and Humanity before.

On a side note- R&#39;hen seemed adamant to have the away party take off our suits, as the technology unsettled him- I&#39;d like to have both Medical and Science test air quality and the possible ability of Starfleet personnel breathing their atmosphere.

A Planet of four Cultures
By: Ensign Kytha Briar

    The Planet of Gramen is home to four distinct groups of people. Each for the most part seems to correspond with a particular area of the planet. Three of these cultures seem to be self-isolating when it comes to the others, preferring to keep to themselves and not much interaction happens between them. The last of the four tended to keep the technological advances of their neighbors at bay. In the course of this article, I shall discuss each of these species at length and explain their unique dynamic as well as the process of Transcendence.

The Usaniir are a plant-based humanoid species native to the jungles of Gramen. They appear to have the same biological needs as plants and can photosynthesize sugar. They also have the ability to control plant life around them. They live in a clearing in the forest in huts constructed from wood. They also use metals and plastics in their buildings. They pride themselves on using renewable materials and take great pride in sustainability. Eco-Friendliness is their top priority when it comes to technological advances. Usaniirs have no concept of gender. Gender is completely foreign to them. They simply see each other as fellow beings. They consider each other equals and can choose whatever occupation they desire. They have quite similar occupations to other groups. Artisans, builders, caretakers, and teachers are all paths they can pursue. They don’t use any form of currency. They believe that they should work together for the betterment of each other but trade does happen occasionally. They form families with an extended family structure. Households seem to contain two parents and children. It is unknown whether the extended family is apart of the household. The Usaniir seem to be hermaphrodites, either partner is capable of bearing young. Decisions are governed by a council of elders.</div></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace"><div class="pre pre--multiline nohighlight">The elders and the scientists of the Usaniir tend to disagree because the elders believe technology to be a waste of time as a natural recurring catastrophe had set back any technological advances for many years. This has caused the Usaniir to try and protect what advancements they have by constructing a bunker underground to house their technology. They keep to themselves as the Mlimari react violently towards them and the Bahariens stay in their mountains, the two having little need to interact.

The Mlimari are an aquatic humanoid species that live in the oceans of Gramen. They are quite enigmatic, only seeing those on the land as food. They are an extremely hostile species and have a hard time listening to reason. That isn’t to say they can’t be reasoned with. They just tend to be stubborn and focused on obtaining resources and food. Due to this, little is known about them at present. 

The Baharien are a race of igneous rock-based lifeforms. They are born from the molten lava of the volcano when it erupts. Because of this, they view the volcano as a god. Very rarely, a Baharien may be born with a crystalline form. It is considered a blessing when a crystalline Baharien is born. An average Baharien lives about 160 years before they crumble and turn to dust. Crystalline Baharens tend to exceed this limit due to their different mineral makeup. They seem to use a form of democracy as decisions are voted upon though it’s structure is unknown. They seem to have a leader who bears the title of Consol. Although further research is needed, they seem to dedicate a large amount of their time to worshiping their god.</div></span>

They consider themselves the caretakers of the other three species that inhabit Gramen. They seem to view themselves as superior to the other inhabitants. They had gone through a painful process known as Transcendence. They used their technology to create the catastrophes that plague the planet to keep the other races from going through the process. As of present, they seemed to have back down from this stance and allowed the others to go through Trancendance.

The Transcendence itself is an extremely painful process. What causes it to trigger biologically is unknown but when a member of a race reaches a certain spot, Transcendence occurs for all members of that race. As of writing this, all the races on Gramen have gone through the Transcendence. The Usaniir froze to death, The Baharians drowned, and the Mlimari Suphocated. Every member underwent ‘death’. No life signs of any of the races were detected during this event. The exact effects of this process on each race are mostly unknown. All that is known for now is that the Usaniir gained the ability to become incorporeal and travel through space.

In summary, Gramen is a diverse planet with multiple sentient life forms. There is still much unknown about the people of this world. Further research is desperately needed into the diverse cultures of Gramen. The biological and cultural differences are so unique that we could learn a lot by studying these people.</div></span>

A Division of Cultures
By: Ensign Kytha Briar

    Xoidia Prime is the home planet of the Crix’oids. However, hundreds of years ago, a ship containing a group of Humans and Vulcans, now known as the Azvadellians crashed landed on the surface. The two have warred for over a century and have decided to isolate themselves from each other. These two distinct cultures have both flourished in their own way.

The Crix’oids or the Xoids are the natives of this world. They are translucent, humanoid hexapods. While they have their own verbal language, they also communicate through SSL. They were taught this through Cadet Fraiser, a survivor of the crash that initially brought the Azvadellians to Xoidia Prime. Due to the war with the Azvadellians, they are a bit wary of outsiders. The Crix’oids show great care for life in that they use non-lethal weapons against the Azvadellians. They developed the technology cloaking the planet, showing that their society has made great technological advancements. After the ending of the war, The Xoids have decided to use their technology to cut themselves off from the Azvadellians in an effort for peace.</div></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace"><div class="pre pre--multiline nohighlight">The Azvadellians are a group comprised of Humans and Vulcans as well as hybrids of the two races. They are the descendants of the survivors of the Falcon 1170. This was a ship deployed by HSIA (Houston Space Intelligence Agency) an underground agency devoted to harnessing alien life and technology. Having discovered the Xoid’s home planet, they set to explore it and take the Xoids technology. The Falcon 1170 was their last attempt to reach the planet that seemingly failed, causing HSIA to go under. Unbeknownst to them, the ship had reached the surface at a cost. The officers disembarked and settled. Led by Captain Harlow, They attempted to steal the Xoids technology. This lead to the two civilizations being at war for hundreds of years. They have formed a city called Azvadel on the surface of the planet and seem to function like a Twenty-first-century human society. They have a democratic government and an elected President. The Vulcans notably do not follow the teachings of Surrak. Although remnants of his teachings can be found in their history. After realizing the truth of the situation with the Xoids, They have come to a peaceful agreement to stay away from them.

    In conclusion, The Unique situation of Xiodia Prime is an example of how sudden colonization of a planet already inhabited with sentient life can cause unique cultural distinctions. Although the conflict between the two has greatly torn the two apart, this new peace can bring healing. Hopefully, with time, The two can fully reconcile and live together, embracing their differences.</div></span>

On a personal note, I would like to highlight the deeds of Cadet Fraiser of the Falcon 1170. He was stranded on an alien planet, exiled by the other survivors because of his disability, and yet he still persevered. He was the first to reach out to the Crix’oids and facilitate communication with them, an act that would allow us to communicate with them hundreds of years later. He was adamant about how not all the Azvadellians were bad. He laid the framework for the peace they have achieved. Very few have the courage and the strong morality that Cadet Fraiser displayed and that is something worth being remembered and celebrated for.</div></span>

Subject: Neutronium Analysis and Research Report

Neutronium, known only to be found at the core of a collapsing star, is an extremely rare element. Starfleet has not managed to successfully produce the alloy as of yet, but there have been several instances of neutronium production and usage by other races and unknown groups over time. Perhaps the most well known (and topically relevant as of the current time) is by the Iconians, particularly during the Iconian war. However, it has also been known to be in use by the Dominion and in the discovery of the only known Dyson Sphere by the USS Enterprise-D*.
In this report, I will be focusing on the use of neutronium by Iconians as a means to discuss ways it may be either counteracted, obtained, or even destroyed for the purposes of our current tactical developments in relation to the supposed future Iconian conflict.
Neutronium consists only of neutrons; this makes the element highly radioactive. It is most easily collected in gaseous form, then processed through the use of high gravity manipulation (also known as antigravity). As mentioned earlier in this report, is only found at the core of a neutron star. Finding a star suitable for the production of neutronium, however, is no easy feat- said star must have a mass much larger than the mass of the Earth’s Sun, and in order to produce an sizeable quantity of neutronium, it must have an iron core of no less than 1.4 but no more than 3 solar masses**- if the core is denser than the maximum amount, it will surpass the supernova stage and instead collapse into a black hole.
It is also important to note that neutronium cannot exist outside of the pressures of a neutron star- this is why it must be collected in gaseous form and compressed using antigravity.</div></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace"><div class="pre pre--multiline nohighlight">Now that the creation of neutronium has been discussed, it is important to move on to the second facet of this report- how it may be possible to obtain, defend against, and/or destroy neutronium. Through my research, I have discovered that the containment of neutronium is hypothetically possible with a modified version of technology Starfleet has possessed for generations. The containment of neutronium could be achieved by the use of gravimetric spatial distortion. A precise use of gravitons to construct a strong enough gravitational field would contain the neutronium, stopping it from dispersing into the surrounding environment due to its lack of charge and electrostatic forces, however the field itself must also be contained; the effect of such a high gravitational distortion would affect anything making contact with it that cannot handle the pressure.
As for the use and/or destruction of neutronium, far less research exists. Neutronium is known to be impervious to the current phaser and torpedo iterations in use by Starfleet, however this does not necessarily indicate that the element is wholly indestructible. As of yet, the only known way to destroy a ship or object made of neutronium is to force it to implode. However, there is another aspect of neutronium that may be useful in finding another way to cause a detrimental reaction to the element. Since neutronium can exist in a solid state only inside an immense pressure similar to that of a neutron star, it is possible that some sort of graviton distortion is in use by the races currently known to have produced the element. As mentioned earlier, however, this must be a contained distortion. Unless the Iconians or Dominion members are impervious to the immense pressures of the core of a neutron star, it can be assumed that if they have successfully contained the neutronium with a field similar to the one previously described, they have also contained the field itself.</div></span>

I view this research as worthy of discussion with both the engineering and tactical divisions; perhaps some sort of modified torpedo or other weapon could achieve the effects I have described in the latter half of this report.

Stardate: 154056.525

By: Claire Reviere, Tactical Officer, USS Phoenix

The scans carried out on each of the 16 phaser arrays the ship possesed indicated that they are all in optimium working condition and no errors were recorded in the scans of allignment of each of the phaser arrays. The armoury inventory check  of type 2 phaser guns revealed one to be faulty with a jammed power level setting mechanism. This has been rectified immediately. The rest of the type 2 and type 3 phaser guns were found to be in good working condition with no faults recorded during thorough inspection of all units.</span></span>

<div class="pre pre--multiline nohighlight">I was approached by Commander Blanche Carslile the same day that I received approval to begin my research with the Lanthanis zalismenos fungus. She informed me that there was to be a joint Intel and Security mission during which the benefits of my research could be applied. I agreed to join them. A day later, COS Commander Parlac and Captain Syrezeaju came to retrieve me from the medical lab, as the mission was to begin immediately.</div>

<div class="pre pre--multiline nohighlight">I did not receive much information about the mission other than that the target, Noi, was extremely dangerous and that I would be the only medical officer along. I got the Cap’s approval to use the experimental treatment. We transferred my research to the Chimera’s sickbay, which was rather well equipped.</div> 

<div class="pre pre--multiline nohighlight">I put the away team on diets tailor made to each individual in order to prepare their immune systems to fight off the fungus after it had served its purpose. Because I had only just started research, the treatment was virtually non-existant. I worked for the entire week in which the Chimera traveled. I took only two three-hour breaks every twenty-four hours. I apologize for having so little detail here. I took extensive notes of my process in my lab notebook, which will be made available upon request. My memory during this time is very vague. I was running on less than four hours of sleep and several large doses of caffeine daily.</div> 

<div class="pre pre--multiline nohighlight">Commander Parlac was the first to begin the treatment. He had no serious adverse side effects, so I went ahead with the other’s treatments. None of them experienced any either.</div></span>

Judging from the damage in Commander Parlac’s ears, he was injured during this time, but did not request a beam-out. I awoke and went to the bridge to see how things were going. I assisted in the beaming of Kennox Ephrix into the Chimera’s brig. I went down to give him a check over. He had no injuries of note.</div> 

<div class="pre pre--multiline nohighlight">I was then called back up to sickbay. The team had returned with the target. Noi had a large laceration in his gut from a bladed weapon, presumably a large knife. His lower GI tract was completely severed from his upper GI tract. He had already nearly bled out by the time he was in sickbay. I began to attempt reconstruction, but he died on the operating table. There was nothing I could do.</div> 

<div class="pre pre--multiline nohighlight">Two other members of the team were injured. Both Commander Parlac and Lt. JG Copernicus King both arrived unconscious from telepathic trauma which caused them to faint. Commander Parlac’s eardrum was burst in one ear. He will have trouble hearing out of that ear for some time. When we docked with the Phoenix, both patients were beamed to sickbay and Noi’s corpse was sent to the morgue.</div>

Re: Conversation with Kennox Ephrix

I spoke with ensign Ephrix in the brig earlier. He is disturbed, emotional and deeply regretful of his actions on the station. I questioned him as to his work in collaboration with agent Noi and his reasons for the same. 

He made mention of various illeegal scientific experiments in the area of genetic modification - allegedly creating a Jem&#39;hadar, a Breen/Undine hybrid named Rhys and a Changeling. This remains consistent with the last time he did the same; creating &#39;friends&#39; in order to provide companionship in the same way. The report detailing the same is annexed herein. 

The more disturbing revelation, however, came when he mentioned rear admiral Kohl th&#39;Ereven, who enlisted his help in an attempt to bring former admiral Phenna Ephrix back to life - in fact he alleges that is how he came into contact with agent Noi in the first place.

He also alleges that the two of them succeeded - and that she regularly speaks to him expressing support for his work, and then disappointment as to the loss of the same. This being said I noticed that he seemed not to be in a stable frame of mind for this portion of the conversation; seeing that his emotional state and accordingly tone of voice seemed erratic during this segment of our conversation. 

I would normally first turn to the possibility that the veracity of his claim is affected by his current state of mind - had he not mentioned Tal Shiar technology in the very same vein. Tal Shiar technology hss been shown to be able to carry out unholy feats of science including forcing admiral Ephrix back into her incorporeal form and using the same to destroy planets at a whim.</div></span>

For now I recommend that we remain vigilant. As to ensign Ephrix, I believe it would be beneficial to his state of mind to allow him visitors to his brig cell. In his time with us as a medical cadet he gained the trust and friendship of many members of the crew. I believe that, in spite of all that he has done, that they will be more than willing to lend him an ear and companionship throughout his stay aboard. 

My impression of ensign Ephrix in summary is that he yearns for friendship, recognition and association above other things, which I have known of him since he was still with us - which agent Noi provided to him and he took in desperation. This being said those do not excuse his actions thus far and I trust Starfleet&#39;s Admiralty to deal with them as approoriate.</div></span>

Subject: Diagnostic anomaly report - resolved

<div class="pre pre--multiline nohighlight">I detected a foreign subroutine during a routine diagnostic of the torpedo systems on Stardate 155067.31. The program could not be isolated and its function could not be identified before deleting itself. However, a fragment was recorded and Ensign Tan recognized the symbol set as that of the Iconian virus that infiltrated the Phoenix&#39;s systems during the battle on Stardate 154034.4.

Level one diagnostics have been performed on all systems in Tactical&#39;s scope, and this information was passed to Operations, who did the same with remaining ship systems. All systems are reported clear of this or other anomalies.

Review of modification logs in both Tactical systems and the systems first affected by the Iconian virus during battle confirmed that the foreign subroutine was derived from the Iconian virus introduced on Stardate 154034.4 and that no traces appear to remain in the Phoenix&#39;s systems. Vigilance is still advised.

Subject: Science Shadow Project

<div class="pre pre--multiline nohighlight">Firstly I&#39;d like to say thank you for the volunteers who have agreed to shadow, I realize this is a mild inconvenience but I appreciate you taking this on for the benefit of the younger science staff in helping them gain an additional skill set as well as learning more about other departments and how science ties into most of them in some form or another. The scope of work for them is suggested to be a basic introduction of your responsibilities, you may treat them as a bit of a pseudo-assistant as they have all expressed excitement at being hands on in the involvement of this project. Thank you once more, and I hope this favor has not impacted your day to day in a negative way.
The pairings are as listed.

Mission Report Noi Capture and Extraction.




The Security Team were called to the Security Hub by Lieutenant Commander Rekat Parlac and were told that we were going to be assisting Intelligence on a mission and were told that 3 volunteers were needed.   I was one who volunteered alongside Ensign Jaime  Devereux and Lieutenant Serela t&#39;Tumisa and were told that some might not come home.  I was piloting the shuttle and on my point of view everything went well and I was able to dock the shuttle to the station airlock.   I was given high praise by Lieutenant Commander Parlac and The Away team members that were going on the surface had adverse reactions to Lieutenant Junior Grade Ciel’s fungus vaccination. 



A few hours after the ground team arrived on the station a few hours in I had received immediate transmission form the Lieutenant Commander to beam the team back to ship as the station was due to blow up. I had managed to get the team back on board within a good time frame and we had another prisoner taken.


When I beamed them back we had heard that Noi had died due to blast and not getting out.  When I got back to ship I had a brief with Captain Syrezeaju about the mission and she had asked me some questions about the mission and how it went from a helmsman point of view.

1: Intelligence update. 
Elija Noi was captured but killed on scene. Full details of suspect’s death will be attached when possible. Team has been debriefed other than Lieutenant Selera. Still awaiting reports from majority of away team but many have been recovering in this time. Attached are current Reports from attending medical officer and helmsmen. Debriefings have clarified sequence of events and this will later be provided in said reports. It should be noted that another prisoner was taken – Kennox Ephrix. More information on this to follow in next section. Please see attached documents 1A and 1B for information gathered so far. 

2. Potential virus. 
Tactical officers discovered a virus within our systems. They have determined that it is Iconian in origin and is residual from the initial attack upon our vessel during which they made efforts to hack our systems. Intelligence and Operations have deemed that it is not a threat but will also keep monitoring the integrity of systems. If at all possible, please advise other vessels of this occurrence. We have already checked with our partner vessel and they have not experienced anything untoward so we are hopeful this will not occur again. Please see attached documents 2A and 2B for reports given.&quot;</div></span>

Officers apprehended one ‘Kennox Ephrix’ – former Starfleet officer – from the same station that they collected Noi from. In conversation with him the officers have discovered that he was asked by one Admiral Kohl th’Ereven of Starfleet Tactical to help assist in reviving Fleet Admiral Phenna Ephrix. Kennox Ephrix seems determined that this was a success, however Lieutenant Verne is worried for the potential of this having been the Terran Empire counterpart who the vessel have encountered before. We are aware of entity theory and it is currently flying alongside our ship – uncertain if this holds significance. Kennox Ephrix has since taken unwell and it is believed this may have been due to psionic attack by Terran Empire counterpart of Fleet Admiral Phenna Ephrix. Medical report to follow, current information is on attached documents 3A and 3B.

4. Requests. 
Please advise as to next steps for transportation of Noi and Ephrix to medical facilities. Authorities should be informed for the detention of Admiral Kohl th’Ereven. Further information will be provided at earliest possible convenience. For further clarification please message back.&quot;</div></span>

Mission Status: Failed, target deceased.

Target Status: Deceased.

     Mission was originally brought to myself and Lieutenant Junior Grade King by Niriwa Vann, head of the CSID. She informed us that Elija Noi, Federation’s Most Wanted, had been escaping our capture by using cloning technology to duplicate himself and remain undetected. She gave us a small chip, one that had been lodged inside the brain of a Noi clone. She informed us that is was the last one they had, as all others had been locked due to too many attempts to access the information inside. After cracking the scrambler code embedded in the chip, our mission was to follow the trail inside the chip to Noi’s assumed location. She also presented us a psychic nullification device, able of making one invisible to a telepath, and rendering a telepath unable to use their abilities.</div></span>

First, I designed a customized terminal to read the data on the chip. I will attach plans for the device at the end of this log. Lieutenant King had been working on modifying a strain of the Hornet virus to break into the chip, however we had to start from scratch and make a new one, as Hornet by design is to be aggressive. After developing this new program which we nicknamed Scalpel, we began to devise a way to open the chip. However, the chip had to actually register a brain to activate. So Lieutenant King devised a way to use holographic brain and fool the chip. While the Lieutenant went to get information on the brain we were writing, Lieutenant Commander Parlac came in, followed by Commander Dunamis. Parlac had already been briefed on the mission by Niriwa. After briefing them on our progress, King came back with the relevant information we needed and we got back to work.</div></span>

Lieutenant King managed to create an audio recording of the coordinates before they degraded too much to be read. We made our way down the Chimera, along with Ensign Devereux, Ensign Ashwood, Lieutenant t’Tumisa, Lieutenant Junior Grade Ciel, and Lieutenant Commander Parlac. We boarded the Chimera swiftly and undocked, heading for the first set of coordinates. The Phoenix and it’s partnered vessel the nL’RaH followed behind until we reached the Oralus system. When we stopped, we hid in the orbit of a Class D planetoid, masking our warp signature to match the radiation of the planet, effectively hiding us from any sensors in the area. After trying to find evidence of any vessels in the area, we came to the conclusion that Noi’s ship must be cloaked. After scanning the Class J planet where our coordinates pointed to, we found a cloaked space station in orbit of the planet. Using images we made and myself hacking and confusing the enemy sensors, Ensign Ashwood guided the ship and docked it at the station, while it was under cloak. Lieutenant Ciel dosed us with an experimental fungus he developed designed to act as a natural painkiller as well.</div></span>

After disabling the alarm, it was revealed that Commander Parlac had gone temporarily deaf due to the noise from the alarm. King offered the Commander one of his hearing aids, and the mission continued. The next room we entered was what appeared to be a large server room, with three Noi clones. They attempted to escape, however myself, Ensign Devereux and Lieutenant t’Tumisa caught all three. One almost immediately killed itself on the Lieutenant’s blade. While interrogating the other two, the lulled themselves by using some sort of device in their jaw. During our pursuit, one clone started a server wipe.

After finding and crawling through a set of Jefferies tubes, I ended up in some sort of cloning laboratory. Noi was talking to someone I couldn’t immediately recognize, but after he left, I could see who he was talking to. Ex-Cadet Kennox Ephrix was working for Noi. During this, he revealed a piece of information to me. He says he’s resurrected the late Phenna Ephrix. Of course, this remains unproven. After securing the lab with the help of the away team, Ephrix released his clones on the team. Commander Parlac ordered me to hand over Ephrix and get into the tubes to hunt Noi down. I obeyed my orders. After arriving in the shuttle bay, the away team had beaten me to it and were distracting Noi. As I approached, it appeared he had used telepathy to kill Commander Parlac, and the Lieutenant King. In what I can only assume was a severe lack in judgement, Lieutenant t’Tumisa stabbed Noi, and almost hit me. At the same time, I had gotten close enough to plant the null device on Noi. This rendered him powerless as he died by the Lieutenants blade. When Noi died, the station began a self destruct sequence. The remaining team members were transported back to the ship before the detonation. After taking a head count, Lieutenant Ciel attempted to save Noi, but failed. However, Lieutenant Commander Parlac and Lieutenant along were both alive, albeit with some mental trauma. We returned to the Phoenix shortly after.

Stardate: 155074.4
Subject: Away Mission to capture Elija Noi

<div class="pre pre--multiline nohighlight">On Stardate 155056.9, the Security Department of the USS Phoenix (NCC-93472) was called to the ship’s Security Hub by the CoS, Lt. Cmdr. Parlac, for a Mission Briefing.
It was upon my arrival at the Sec. Hub that Cmdr. Parlac informed me that I would be a good fit for the upcoming away mission which he was about to brief us on. In the end, this briefing was very concise, and due to the secretive nature of the mission, most of the details were omitted. It was however conveyed to us that this mission would be a dangerous one and we were informed of the possibility that we would not return.
Due to Cmdr. Parlac’s recommendation, I decided to volunteer for this mission alongside Ensign Robert Ashwood and Lieutenant Serela t’Tumisa. Upon volunteering, the rest of the Department was dismissed, and the three Volunteers were then fully briefed on the mission (to capture Elija Noi) in the Briefing Room.

After the Briefing, Commander Parlac was alerted that Lieutenants K&#246;nig and King had cracked a tracking device which allowed us to locate Noi on a cloaked Space Station orbiting the fourth planet in the Oralus System in the Archimedes-Class ship, ‘Chimera’. Lt. K&#246;nig was able to use two programs of his own design to block the station’s sensors from detecting the Chimera.
We needed to use Tachyon Radiation to locate the Station’s Airlock, upon which, Ensign Ashwood executed a manoeuvre which allowed us to dock with the Station.</div></span>

K&#246;nig then attempted to unlock the door at the end of the hallway, whereupon a siren began to sound which rendered most of the Away Team unable to act. Luckily, Lt. JG. King was able to remove his hearing aids and was able to open the door and disable the alarm. After this, it was discovered that Lt. Cmdr. Parlac had gone temporarily deaf, and Lt. King gave the Commander one of his hearing aids, allowing him partial hearing for the rest of the mission.

 After we left the hallway, we reached what appeared to be some kind of Command or Comms Centre. Inside which, we located three clones of Noi one of whom, initiated a data wipe (which we were unable to halt) before we were able to apprehend them.
We then began to question the three clones on the contents of the data, yet before we were able to get answers, one of the clones slit his own throat on the blade of Lieutenant t&#39;Tumisa&#39;s sword, which she had been using to restrain him. The other two then utilised something similar to the 20th century Earth Cyanide pill, to end their lives. We were, however, able to locate a schematic of the station which showed another hallway with one room at the other end, the Shuttle Bay.
At this point, it was decided that Lt. K&#246;nig should split from the rest of the group and make his way to the Shuttle Bay (where we believed Noi would be making his escape) through the Jefferies Tubes, as he was equipped with a Psy-Null device which rendered Noi unable to sense him and if placed on Noi would disable his Telepathic Powers.</div></span>

However, it was later revealed to be an illusion created by Noi, who seemed to appear further down the hallway.
Upon seeing Noi, Cmdr. Parlac and Lt. King both tried to advance on him but were stopped by mental images of their legs sinking into the floor. It was at this point that I realised the mental images wouldn’t have an effect if somebody couldn’t see them. And so, closing my eyes, I made my way towards Noi. This tactic worked although it was revealed Noi was not in fact there and the Hallway was not as long as it had seemed. I then informed my teammates of this technique and once they applied it, they were able to join me at the end of the hall.

After reaching the end of the hallway, we discovered the station layout had been falsified, as once we opened the door, we discovered a small room with two doors leading off to separate rooms, behind one of which, we heard voices and Lt. King identified one of these voices as Lt. K&#246;nig.
Once we entered the room, we discovered it was some sort of Cloning Lab in which we found Kennox Ephrix. It appeared that he had been working with Noi and providing him with the clones which we encountered earlier, as well as performing some other genetic experiments.
Many of these clones and experiments attacked us, and though we tried to stun them, in the end it was impossible to save them, because of Noi’s initiation of the Self-Destruct Program
Once we had captured Ephrix and were able to get out of the lab, we proceeded to the other room which *was* the Shuttle Bay. Once again, Lieutenant K&#246;nig, went through the Jefferies Tubes.</div></span>

It was then that Lieutenant K&#246;nig emerged from the Jefferies tubes and snuck up behind Noi and attached the Psy-Null device to Noi. At which point, Lieutenant t&#39;Tumisa, who I believe was emotionally compromised due to the apparent deaths of Cmdr. Parlac and Lt. King rushed forward with her sword and due to the Psy-Null device, Noi was unable to defend himself and died before the Chimera returned to the Phoenix.</div></span>

Stardate: supplementary 

If you’re a senior officer then you already know what’s happened to Ephrix so I won’t be going into too much detail about that. I’ve put my personal project to the side for now in favor of my counselor training. And I finally got to see some of the new medical officers in action, I was impressed by Mister Drake’s ability to handle well under pressure. And one new Denobulan; who’ve I’ve neglected to meet had impressed me with her bedside manner. Even when the patient is out cold, she still feels the need to comfort them... which is a quality that I lack in myself. As for the ship itself, issuing a ship-wide medical training program was a great start, but it wasn’t quite enough.. there needs to be more; so I’ve decided to update and requisition medical kits in key areas of the ship, evidently they’d already have been in place. But it seems starfleet has neglected to mention where they were installed- I myself haven’t seen a single one, I’ve always had to run back to sickbay and retrieve one, and that’s less than efficient. True, it’ll only be basic equipment.. but that equipment is enough to keep one alive until the real medics can take over. I’ll start the requisition tomorrow after I get approval from the captain. </div></span>

LIEUTENANT JUNIOR GRADE COPERNICUS KING
STARDATE: 155073.9
<div class="pre pre--multiline nohighlight">Beginning at the start of this. CSID Head Niwira Vann came to Phoenix to speak with myself and Lieutenant Konig, in regards to one Elija Noi. Noi has been flying under the radar with no success of capture by Starfleet. The reason for this being that he has been using clones to throw others off of his breadcrumb trail. SI had managed to catch four of these clones, but found that they degraded soon upon capture, rendering them unable to submit to an interrogation. However it was discovered that these Noi clones had computer chips implanted in their brains as a way to send and receive information to Noi as well as track coordinates. Unfortunately, SI proper has had little success with cracking the chips, attempting on three and ending up with the chips locked out and degrading with no success of receiving viable information.

Vann tasked Konig and myself to try and crack into the chip, stressing that it was the last chance they had to get the information they were seeking. It is understandable that Vann did not have much faith in the attempt but we took on the assignment with the promise of results. Our first thought was to use Lt. Konigs Hornet program but quickly discovered that Hornet would be far too aggressive for such a delicate device and reprogramming would waste precious time that we did not have. Instead Konig developed another program known as Scalpel which was much more precise and delicate to retrieve the information requested while I used information from Sickbays records of Noi to write a “brain” in an attempt to retrieve the information. Unfortunately this also proved unsuccessful, leaving us temporarily stuck. We took a long shot and used the holo-projector in the hub to create a hologram of Nois brain using the data codes I’d written as well as Scalpel.</div></span>

Working together, Konig and I managed to break through the many layers of coding to discover a list of coordinates. An unfortunate side effect of this was that the chip began to degrade which would affect the data we received. I created an audio file with a list of the coordinates that we then transferred to the Chimera. Once we had this information, we made our way to the ship and left to follow the trail of coordinates.
On our way there, all members of the crew underwent a special diet so that we may accept Lt. Ciel’s experimental…..mushrooms, basically. The goal of these was to dull the nerve endings and reduce pain reactions. We followed the coordinate trail recorded from the chip to a Class J planetoid, which was shown to be uninhabited. The planet also emitted a varying  low level radiation which we matched our warp signature to as a way to remain hidden from other craft. As we were there, we uncovered a space station and assumed that is where Noi was hiding. We proceeded and dock and organise an away team.</div></span>

We moved towards a hallway where we encountered our first issue. In the attempt to get through the door, an alert was triggered, causing an alarm klaxon to ring. This alarm was loud and piercing enough to cause severe pain and temporarily disable us. After a moment of being stunned, I was able to take out my hearing aids out and managed to disable the alert and finish breaking through the door. 

Unfortunately the alert had damaged Lt. Cmdr’s hearing and cause temporary hearing loss. To remedy this, I gave him one of my hearing aids to give him partial hearing until we returned to the Chimera. We came upon a server room with three Noi clones, one of which pressed a button which seemed to delete any vital information. We caught the Noi clones but had no luck retrieving information from them. One clone slit it’s own throat on Lt. Serelas blade, and the other committed suicide as well. At this point, we were able to uncover a layout of the station as well as the layout of Jeffries tubes. Lt. Konig put on the psy-null device we received from Vann and started through the Jeffries tubes to find Noi while the rest of us provided a distraction.
We continued on our way down the hall to two doors, one of which was not on the official layout. While we decided on a door, one had voices coming from it, one being Lt. Konig and the others….at that time unknown but assuming one was Noi. As we entered the room, Noi ran and--Computer, pause recording.

Computer, resume. Where was I? Oh yes.</div></span>

In the room was Noi and Ensign Kennox Ephrix, who was thought to be working with the Breen still. Noi ran and we confronted Ephrix, who we managed to stun. Before this, he had activated the vats and set the clones on the group. Some of the more mature clones with developed telepathic abilities put psychic attacks on us, Lt. Serela thought her skin was flaking off, one giving me the feeling of fluid in my lungs. The clones were dispatched and Ephrix was transferred to the brig on the Chimera. When we had recovered from the clone attack, we continued on. Though the hallway this time was longer, much longer. This turned out to be a trick played on us by Noi, which we overcame after realising it had no effect if we closed our eyes.

We came up on the shuttle bay, finding Noi in his shuttle preparing to escape. When we came in, Noi placed a psychic attack on Lt. Cmdr. Parlac, dropping him as if he was dead. I was also a victim of this attack and Commander Parlac going down is the last thing I remember.

A few hours later, I woke up in the sickbay back on the USS Phoenix. I have since found out that our mission failed as Noi was killed in the apprehension process. Kennox Ephrix has been transferred to the brig on the Phoenix. End audio log.</div></span>

USS Phoenix — Surgical Report
Status: URGENT — Awaiting Review 

Patient name: Kennox Ephrix
History number: 0030 - 44324
Stardate: 155073.02
Clinical Team: Commander Blanche Carlisle, Lieutenant Amy Parsons, Lt. JG. Ciel, Lt. JG. Eli Drake, Lt. JG. Zulola Jex, Ensign Trephta. 

Postoperative Diagnosis: Supposed unspecified psychic attack, patient has been placed on life support and transferred to the ICU for monitoring. 

Anesthesia: General

Intervention Performed: 
Synaptic stimulants administered after initial readings of seizures and recorded loss of brain function. 
Anticoagulants and IV administered to compensate for patient’s loss of fluid, antiepileptics administered but non-effective in reducing patient’s convulsions. 
Cardioversion initiated upon VT, 100J, raised to 200J following lack of response — non-effective.
CPR initiated upon asystole, epinephrine administered and patient intubated — effective.
Psy-null device attached following cardiopulmonary stabilisation to restore brain function — effective. 
Propofol administered intravenously and ventilation initiated upon stabilising of vitals.

Operation Notes:
The following report has been forwarded as a result of concerns raised by the nature of the patient’s condition. Attached for reference are Lieutenant Parson’s readings recorded from the brig, and those taken during the operation. Disturbances in the patient&#39;s brain&#39;s electrical activity and his lack of response to conventional methods imply some form of external interference, and thus, a potential security threat to the wider crew. No other party present was affected by the interference, which ceased to have impact on the patient after the application of the psy-null device retrieved from Elija Noi’s corpse.

Compiled and submitted for review by Doctor Blanche Carlisle, CMO.</div></span>

To: Cpt. Syrezeaju
From: Cmdr. Dunamis

As part of her job shadowing programme, lieutenant Howard and I visited deck nine and spoke to several members of the crew, chosen as it is a I must report that, despite our best efforts, crew sentiment remains somewhat tense. In fact, to use many of the crew&#39;s own terms, they report being &#39;scared shitless.&#39; Understandably so; no one would wish the horrors and stress of living in wartime on another. Especially not against the Iconians, whose actions precipitated the near-collapse of a species and a supernova among further horrors.

We must bring up morale, somehow. Not with a party or anything of the sort - for now I&#39;m afraid that all we may be able to do is to to simply remind them that we are there for them always, through the thick and thin - and to the light at the end of the tunnel or bitter end, if things come to that.</div></span>

<div class="pre pre--multiline nohighlight">I created a mock battle environment in holodeck 3 to test the effects of a 136-isoton gravimetric warhead design created by engineer Ensign Cassidy Greenfield and torpedo specialist Ensign Joseph Tan against simulated neutronium. Target was a neutronium sphere 15km in diameter with an antiproton beam generator. Lieutenant Commander Amanda Higgins, CEO and Lieutenant Maggie Verne, ACTO, observed the test and can verify the results, attached below. Safeties were confirmed to be functional and active.

A test of 9 gravimetric warheads detonated simultaneously (+1 failure to hit) destroyed the sphere and emitted a shockwave that destroyed the test ship. (1) A test of a singular warhead caused significant structural damage, but fell short of disabling the vessel. Two, aimed well, were able to disable it entirely and produce a shockwave that the ship could withstand at a distance of around 2.5 million kilometers while moving at full impulse. It is therefore evident that the gravimetric warhead design is effective against neutronium. (2)

Under guidance from Lieutenant Commander Higgins, I created a simulated virus in order to test how the torpedo responds to adverse conditions and how well targeting and maneuvering function in a scenario where the ship&#39;s systems are being attacked. While that scenario did end with the ship being overtaken by the shockwave due to a delayed trajectory change, with further practice and a more experienced pilot the Phoenix is ultimately capable of using the gravimetric warheads effectively.

<div class="pre pre--multiline nohighlight"> Introduction
Ensigns Nedras, Greenfield and myself conducted a simulated test firing of a gravimetric torpedo design made by myself and Ensign Greenfield with Lt. Cmdr Higgins, CEO and Lieutenant Verne, ACTO as observers. The target was a sphere consisting of neutronium measuring roughly 1767 cubic kilometers equipped with a antiproton beam generator.

 Test Log
We conducted a total of 4 tests to evaluate the effectiveness of different numbers of torpedoes against the sphere. During all tests, the sphere released a large shockwave upon destruction which will cause significant damage or even destruction to ships in close proximity.

In the first test, 10 torpedoes were fired at the sphere of which, nine (9) hit the target resulting in the complete destruction of the sphere. However, the resulting shockwave also destroyed the test ship. 

In the second test, a single torpedo was fired which caused moderate damage to the sphere but was not enough to disable it. 

In the third test, two (2) torpedoes were fired which were sufficient to completely disable the sphere and caused a shockwave that the test ship managed to withstand at a distance of 2.5 million kilometers out while travelling at full impulse. 

In the fourth and final test which was conducted at the request of Lt. Cmdr Higgins, we tested a scenario whereby the torpedoes were hacked mid-flight as well as to test a targeting systems I have written with the intended purpose of increasing the firing range as to minimize collateral damage to the ship of origin. Although the test ship was overwhelmed by the resulting shockwave from the destruction of the sphere due to delayed course changes and the proximity of the test ship to the sphere, with a more experienced helmsman and further training, this can be perfected to the point where the Phoenix would need to only withstand minimal effects from the shockwave.</div></span>

While admittedly there are still many bugs with targeting algorithm as well as some final modifications to the torpedo designs themselves, the the tests have proven that the concept is sound and practical in our current situation. In the future, we wish to also test the effects of transphasic torpedoes on neutronium to investigate that as a possible alternative due to the lack of gravimetric charges available at the moment.

 Conclusion
While the design is sound and practical, but the lack of gravimetric charges on board (only 10) have forced us to look for further alternatives in the inevitable chance we are to engage in prolong combat against the Iconians or multiple ships at a time. I would like  to request the procurement of more gravimetric charges for use against the Iconians. Moreover, in my research to look for alternatives, I have discovered that transphasic torpedoes may be able to deal significant damage to neutronium due to its properties. Furthermore, myself and Ensign Greenfield have also started to look into ways to make said charges more stable and therefore, safer for storage on board starships. Lastly, I would suggest forwarding these designs (attached below) to Starfleet Tactical for further study. They have far superior facilities and resources at their disposal to continue development.

Subject: Energy Conservation and Inventory Issues

<div class="pre pre--multiline nohighlight">As I’ve been informed by Ensign Morgan, there is a severe discrepancy between supply and demand of necessary cargo such as extra equipment vital to the medical, security, and tactical departments. As a result, I will be scheduling meetings with department heads or assistant heads in order to combat this at least a little, asking for repairs rather than immediate replacements, being mindful of reckless use and gentleness with the more fragile equipment etcetera. Below is the report/explanation sent by Ensign Morgan as to inform me better.

&gt; Due to the declaration of war almost all ships in the fleet have requested resupplies, so much so that there is now a supply shortage for some more important supplies, such as equipment, tools, and even replication matter, which is mainly due to the fact that Starfleet hasn&#39;t manufactured enough of some items to take into account the increase of requests. All departments should be aware of this in order to reduce replication to a minimum. The equipment and tools we have in stock is the only equipment and tools we have available unless we can replicate it, which most cannot be. Breaking anything means you have to get Ops or Engineering to fix it, or you simply won&#39;t have it anymore. As for replication, excess objects/supplies you replicate should always be recycled to reduce waste, and the replication of low-importance items (such as personal objects, decorative items, etc.) should be avoided entirely at this time.

Additionally, I am attempting to devise a comprehensive energy conservation system for yellow and red alerts as to better serve our needs during war time. This will no doubt be a difficult process but I&#39;m sure that the department heads will understand the importance and imminence of this, especially with regards to medical equipment and things that could save lives.

A cultural overview
By: Ensign Kytha Briar

The Iconians are a species native to Iconia in the Beta Quadrant. They were once a humanoid race but now exist as beings of energy. In this compilation, we will cover the history of the Iconian people and their servitor species. 

The Iconians lived on Iconia with another race known as the Heralds. The valued knowledge above all else. They kept all their knowledge in an archive known as the World Heart. They interacted with other species peacefully for many years. However, they kept their knowledge to themselves as they believed that they should not share their technology with “lesser” beings as they would use it to hurt themselves and/or others. One of their most noteworthy technologies is their gateways which allow instantaneous travel across the galaxy.

Envy began to grow amongst other species and tensions grew that eventually lead to several banding together into an alliance to attack the Iconians and take the World Heart by force. They assaulted every colony, leading up to an attack of Iconia itself. The Iconians had anticipated this and tried to advert disaster by evacuating to Iconian colonies, the alliance hunted them down and cornered them in Iconia. Only twelve Iconians survived. They hid underground on Dewa III, being revered by the native inhabitants.</div></span>

They became a lot more aggressive after suffering such a tragedy. They bioengineered the Heralds to make them more suited for combat as well as adopting two more servitor species, The Elachi and the Solanae. Also around this period, the Iconians became energy-based beings. No information exists on how or why this process occurred. The Solanae constructed Dyson spheres which they used to travel through subspace. They used one of these spheres to retreat from the Galaxy and they lived in seclusion for some time. Throughout this time, however, they proceed to gather intelligence and instigate several conflicts, desiring revenge. 

The Tal Shiar began working with the Iconians around 2409. They wanted access to their gateways and a few of them believed that they needed to side with the Iconians anyway as they were too powerful for anyone to stand against. While the Tal Shiar were eventually thwarted, the Iconian threat only grew. While tracking down Empress Sela, Members of the Alpha Quadrant Alliance entered a Dyson Sphere which caused the Iconians to declare war on the whole Milky Way Galaxy in 2410.

Several noteworthy events of the war include:
-The simultaneous invasions of Starbase 234 and New Romulus
-During the Infiltration of an Omega Particle Production Facility, Emperor Kahless duels T’ket. He manages to bring her to her knees and cuts off her arm but is slain before he can land the final blow.
-M’Tera, a prominent Iconian, is slain</div></span>

Alliance forces held off Iconian forces until a Starfleet Officer returned with the World Heart having recovered it. Using this artifact, peace was negotiated with the Iconians. Most of the Iconians decided to go into Isolation and asked not to be disturbed for exactly one millennium. However, T’ket was still filled with anger and rage decided not to comply with the truce. However, She is never heard from again after a group of Ferengi infiltrate her ship to recover the Sword of Kahless, having been lost during T’ket’s battle with Emperor Kahless. 

There are three prominent species under the Iconian’s control. They are the Heralds, the Elachi, and the Solanae. 

The Heralds coexisted with the Iconians on Iconia. They started out as just beasts of burden but the Iconians slowly started genetically modifying them. They made them sentient, using them as personal servants, companions, and pets. After the loss of Iconia, they modified them into their elite soldiers. They are more affectionate with them than their other servitor species.

The Elachi are natives of the Mycelial Network. They reproduce by infecting a humanoid organism with their spores, effectively destroying the mind and body of the host and creating a new being. It unknown how the Iconians persuaded the Elachi to help them, but they were the main army of the Iconians. Their reproductive process allowed them to quickly amass large numbers of troops. After the war, most Elachi returned to the network. It is unknown if they have any kind of relationship still with the Iconians.</div></span>

They can only live in subspace due to their genetic makeup. They were known for abducting people to perform experiments on them. They were also the inventors of the Dyson Spheres. Not much is known about this reclusive race.
In conclusion, The Iconians are a technologically advanced race that can travel across the galaxy using their gateways. They are a reclusive species so not much is known about their culture other than their love for knowledge. They have connections to a few powerful races which also makes them a force to be reckoned with. 

Afterward
I would like to take this moment to propose two theories on the current aggression the Iconians are displaying using the above information. These are only my personal hypothesis and should be treated as such. Theory one is that something has so deeply upset the Iconians that they have come out of their isolation to deal with whatever has offended them. The second is that T’ket has re-emerged and is set on making the Galaxy suffer. These again having nothing substantial backing them up as of me writing this. I feel that it would be a folly to not propose them at least in case any evidence contributing to either emerges. </div></span>

Subject: Mission Report Elija Noi

<div class="pre pre--multiline nohighlight">        Starfleet Intelligence recruited the Phoenix’s Intelligence team (Liutenant Oskar K&#246;nig and Lieutenant Junior Grade Copernicus King) to work on a classified track and capture mission to locate Elija Noi, wanted criminal. Niwira Vann, head of CSID, came aboard the Phoenix while we were docked at ESD to brief the Intelligence team and senior officers. She provided the team with a chip taken from one of Noi’s clones (for more information, see Vann’s report on clones, linked here, which she provided to us as part of the dossier), and a psy-null device (report on that here, again part of the dossier). 
        Our intelligence team set to work cracking the chip, which took them a not insignificant amount of time, and were able to successfully break through the encryptions without destroying the chip itself. During the time they were working, I met with my security team and conveyed the seriousness of the mission before requesting volunteers. The selected volunteers were Ensign Jaime Devereux, Ensign Robert Ashwood, and Lieutenant Serela t’Tumisa. I also requested the assistance of Lieutenant Junior Grade Ciel from Medical, who had been working on an experimental pain killing fungus (see: report from Theodosia Coleridge on Elija Noi’s use of psychic abilities for torture and control) which we hoped he could give to the away team as a barrier against one of Noi’s primary method’s of attack.</div></span>

The Phoenix and accompanying KDF ship NI’RaH followed at a distance. Travel time took approximately a week, during which Lieutenant Junior Grade Ciel provided the team with special dietary requirements to prep for the experimental fungus treatment. The trail lead us to the Oralus IV system, but the Phoenix and NI’RaH were forced to remain outside of the system or risk being seen. The Chimera escaped detection in orbit of a Class D planetoid emitting low-level radiation, which Lieutenant Junior Grade King adjusted the signature of the Chimera to match the radiation while we formulated a plan.
        The coordinates indicated we would find Noi on a gas giant, but initial scans revealed no ships. Determining that Noi must be using cloaking technology, a tachyon scan was used to reveal a space station in orbit around the Class J. It was determined that Ensign Ashwood, the pilot, would remain on the Chimera with Liutenant Junior Grade Ciel, and the rest of us would infiltrate the space station. In order to dock with the station, Lieutenant K&#246;nig remotely hacked into the station’s security to confuse their sensors as Lieutenant Ashwood brought us in to dock.</div></span>

Lieutenant Junior Grade King brought a disruptor and not a phaser, which did not become apparent until later. Ensign Devereux and Lieutenant K&#246;nig were armed per Starfleet standards.) Lieutenant K&#246;nig wore the psy-null device. See attached map of the station, drawn from memory, for use as a guide. Proceeding from Airlock, we entered Hallway Alpha, encountering a sonic alarm which debilatized most of the team except for Lieutenant Junior Grade King, who was able to remove his hearing aids and operate deaf through the sound. He located a keypad and, utilizing Lieutenant K&#246;nig’s PADD with his hacking program, disabled the alarm. I was left mostly deaf from the attack, although my hearing has almost completely returned by this time. Lieutenant Junior Grade King lent me one of his hearing aids for use during the remainder of the mission.</div></span>

They appeared on the offensive at first, then immediately began to retreat, and activated a self-delete protocol on the servers to wipe them of information. It is my belief that these clones attempted to use Noi’s standard telepathic pain attack on us, but found us immune and panicked. The three clones were apprehended, one killed itself on Lieutenant t’Tumisa’s blade, the other two cracked their own teeth open and consumed a suicide pill of some kind (substance unknown, bodies were destroyed when the station went down). All data on the servers was erased and we were unable to save any of it. There was a map on the wall of this room, and we determined based on the map that it was likely the station had Jeffries tubes. From this determination, Lieutenant K&#246;nig entered the tubes, as he would be completely invisible to all psychics onboard the station. We opted to act as a distraction, pushing on. Our goal was to keep Noi occupied until Lieutenant K&#246;nig could make his way through the tubes and get the psy-null device attached to Noi himself.
        From the Server Room, we proceeded to Hallway Beta. Another Noi clone awaited us, although we did not initially see it. The hallway appeared to stretch on much longer than the previous one, and other mental attacks were initiated against the team, including seeing our legs sink into the floor as we attempted to move. Ensign Devereux discovered that the clone could only send mental images in this manner, and directed us to close our eyes. This allowed us to make it to the end of the hallway, although the clone had disappeared by the time we had all collected ourselves.</div></span>

There were two doors, and one of the doors lead to a cloning lab containing Kennox Ephrix. Lieutenant K&#246;nig had already found this room and was speaking with Ephrix when we arrived. (See: full map of cloning lab and all species/experiments documented in the attached file here.) As we entered the room, Ephrix began to grow agitated. He resisted arrest and ordered the computer to release all clones currently in the lab. While most appeared under-developed, some were strong enough to begin psychic attacks. The team was ultimately successful in subduing the clones, but several were outright killed at the hands of Lieutenant t’Tumisa and Lieutenant Junior Grade King. Once we had contained Ephrix, we beamed him to the Chimera’s brig and I instructed Lieutenant K&#246;nig to continue through the tubes as previously agreed.</div></span>

The clones appeared to have suffered from severe genetic fade and were not able to overpower us in the same way Elija himself was. As we attempted to distract him, he threatened Lieutenant Junior Grade King, which prompted me to step between them. I saw that Lieutenant K&#246;nig was approaching from behind and knew that we would only need to keep the man occupied a short while longer, so I hoped I could engage with Elija verbally as a means of distraction. However, Elija utilized telepathy to cause me to believe my heart had stopped working and that I was no longer breathing, and I passed out. To my crewmates, I appeared dead, as Elija was telepathically tricking all of them simultaneously. Beyond this point, the mission details are only what I have been able to read from other reports, but a similar fate befell Lieutenant Junior Grade King and at this Lieutenant t’Tumisa became enraged and attacked Elija with her sword, stabbing him in the gut and nearly wounding Lieutenant K&#246;nig, who had made it close enough to Elija to place the psy-null device on his forehead.</div></span>

Lieutenant Junior Grade Ciel made every attempt to save Elija Noi, but was unsuccessful. With the destruction of the station and the death of Noi, we unfortunately lost our ability to gain any information about who he was, what his goals were, or in fact anything of use. The cloning lab was destroyed, all clones aboard the station were destroyed, all genetic experiments were destroyed, and we barely got away with our lives. The prisoner, Kennox Ephrix, was questioned but experienced a seizure (see: Dr. Blanche Carlisle’s Surgical Report) and is now in a vegetative state and also unable to give answers. I am recovering from the mental and physical attacks sustained during the mission and have returned to duty as Chief of Security.</div></span>

Subject: Cetus Away Mission

<div class="pre pre--multiline nohighlight">Below is a summary of the away mission as it was described to me via mid-mission communications and during a post-mission debrief.

Initial given responsibilities: 

Yllescas - Command
Virol - Communications, engineering analysis
Jex - Medical interventions
T&#39;Khael - Team security
Howard - Radiation analysis, tricorder scans

The away team arrived on the Cetus. They were attacked with a mixture of flour and water upon arrival at the airlock. Ensign Howard attempted to pass through a doorway to the Bridge. Her EV suit was electrocuted, and she immediately returned to the Chimera. The away team was next attacked with a barrage of volleyballs in one of the maintenance shafts followed by a flavored gelatin mixture. They made contact with, then lost sight of the child Roka. They next encountered a glue trap. Trying to avoid the notice of the away team, another child was trapped by the glue. She was freed from the glue via phaser-fire and responded fearfully, but a rapport was soon established when Lt. JG. T&#39;Khael removed her helmet to confirm the away team&#39;s identity. A rapport was established, and Roka re-emerged. Roka led the away team to the childrens&#39; location. After completing initial assessments and earning the childrens&#39; confidence, the away team and children were short-range transported to the Chimera&#39;s sickbay. In the meantime, with the assistance of one of the children, Ensign Virol and Commander Yllescas gained access to the bridge. They discovered a radiation-producing device and Cardassian technology-derived propulsion system interface modifications, purpose unidentified. Scans could not be completed due to radiation. I recommended they leave due to the danger posed by the radiation.</div></span>

The Chimera docked. This girl was treated by Lt. JG. Jex and Lt. JG. Drake, who managed to repair the damage to a significant extent. I cleared the away team to disembark pending decontamination and the children to be beamed to main sickbay at Medical&#39;s convenience. Lt. JG. T&#39;Khael physically exited the Chimera on docking and ran to the Phoenix&#39;s sickbay. The remainder decontaminated and transported to the Phoenix&#39;s sickbay.

Lt. JG. Howard has recommended recovering the Cetus&#39;s black box for additional information, which I second. In light of the propulsion system modifications, I recommend scuttling the Cetus lest they allow the Cetus to be remotely controlled.

Stardate: [The Stardate]

Subject: Bi-Daily Log, Part 1

<span class="pre pre--inline">DEPARTMENT AFFAIRS
- Gravimetric Torpedoes, Ensign Tan
        Ensign Tan reports that the Phoenix currently has ten gravimetric torpedoes at its disposal, with a yield of 136 isotons each. He notes that it will be necessary to have a &quot;significant distance&quot; between the ship and the target, to avoid &quot;heavy or even fatal&quot; damage to the Phoenix from the gravimetric shockwave.
- Targeting Simulation, Ensign Nedras
         Ensign Nedras is creating a simulation-based targeting algorithm to assist in battle against the Iconians. It utilizes &quot;historical data&quot; to determine the likely &quot;position of potential weak points&quot;. His next task is to manually sort through the data, in order to refine and categorize it. I have advised him to create a second program to sort through the data.
- Energy Weapon Diagnostics, Lieutenant JG. Drevas
        Ensign Drevas has run full diagnostics on the energy weapon systems. All is well.
- Targeting Modifications, Lieutenant JG. Drevas
        Lieutenant Drevas also intends to assist Lieutenant Verne in her bolstering of the targeting systems, though he has not made any changes as of yet. I have asked Ensign Nedras to be involved in this project, given the topic of his current work.
- Phaser and Photon Torpedo Systems Diagnostics, Lieutenant JG. S&#39;Kiv
        Lieutenant S&#39;Kiv has run full diagnostics on the Phaser and Photon Torpedo Systems. All is well.
- Theory on Iconians, Ensign Nedras.
        Ensign Nedras has suggested that the Iconians&#39; highest priority is information, not distraction, and he provided evidence to back up his point. Some of his claims are quite dubious, but I believe that his overall argument has some weight. Though I must do further research before passing his ideas up, I believe that we must be prepared for the chance that the Iconians have only demonstrated a fraction of their true power.</span></span>

- Completed Tasks
     -- Adjusted duty roster to cover for quarantined officers. All non-quarantined officers have been given double shifts, with two breaks. This has proven to be quite taxing for the department, but it is necessary. 
     -- Met with Ensign Nedras and Lieutenant JG. Drevas. After discovering that Ensign Tan was neglecting to use his break and ultimately suffering ill effects as a result, both Ensign Nedras and Lieutenant Drevas deemed it necessary to rephrase my orders and involve himself in a situation I was already handling, respectively. I have alerted both that I find this to be poor conduct and have requested that it do not happen again.
     -- Checked-in Lieutenant JG. Drevas, as he did not have the opportunity to do so with Commander Yllescas before the quarantine.
     -- Held Department-wide meeting for non-quarantined officers. I began by taking reports from anyone I had not spoken to already, and proceeded to allow questions and concerns to be voiced. Ensign Tan complained of a headache and dizziness, and I ordered him to eat and hydrate in the hub as soon as the meeting was over and contact Sickbay via commbadge if his symptoms were not eased. I have received no information to indicate what happened after the meeting was over.
     -- Met with Ensign Nedras concerning his theory about the Iconians. See &quot;DEPARTMENT AFFAIRS&quot;. 
- To-Do
     -- Complete further research on Nedras&#39; theory.
     -- Contact Lieutenant Verne and Commander Yllescas about whether training simulations should be held for non-quarantined officers.
     -- Contact Ensign Tan concerning his current status
- CTATS
        I am currently behind on CTATS maintenance. I will remedy this as soon as possible.

Stardate: 155177.95

<div class="pre pre--multiline nohighlight">During a surprise drill, USS Chimera was deployed from USS Phoenix. Start up procedures went smoothly, however it wasn’t until Chimera activated her warp drive when some concerning power fluctuations arose. The fluctuations were caused by misaligned plasma coolant lines leading to the starboard injector assembly. Ensign Skye and myself corrected the issue. Afterward, there was some efficiency issues; the matter/antimatter efficiency was read as 10% under specifications, which I diagnosed as stagnant matter/antimatter pumps. After the injectors were repaired and the coolant lines realigned, I stayed on board the Chimera to monitor the status of the core while I let it run for the next 6 hours and 12 minutes, to work out the oxidation that might’ve accumulated on the various moving parts in the time Chimera sat dormant. I am happy to report that Chimera’s systems are now functioning at 100% efficiency, and she is ready for combat.</div></span>

Stardate: 155188.30

To: Commander T&#39;Svai
CC: Captain Syrezeaju, Senior Staff
Subject: Ensign Nedras (Defection from the Dominion, Termination Implant)

I am making this log of recent events both as requested by Commander T’Svai and as a means of ensuring the full story is recorded.
A bit of time ago, Ensign Nedras made the request to myself, Lieutenant Maggie Verne, Lieutenant Junior Grade Zulola Jex, Ensign Joseph Tan, and Ensign Jaime Devereux to meet with him and discuss his impending official defection from the Dominion. He was looking for our input on his final decisions, and we gave him such.
Yesterday- stardate 155186- was the chosen date, as it was a previously arranged meeting between the Dominion ambassador, Founder Morag, and Lieutenant Junior Grade Ramat’iklan. The seven of us gathered in Lieutenant Ramat’iklan’s quarters, with Lieutenants Verne and Jex, Ensigns Tan and Devereux, and myself standing aside so as to not be seen by Founder Morag. The call began, and after speaking briefly with Lieutenant Ramat’iklan, Morag turned her attention to Ensign Nedras. Nedras informed her that he is “defective”, and she immediately instructed him to activate his termination implant. He did not do so.
I feel it is extremely important that it is known that Founder Morag, a diplomatic ambassador, explicitly threatened Ensign Nedras at this moment; she told him if he ever entered Dominion space again, she would activate his termination implant for him.
The call ended there, and after a moment of conversation Nedras left to make a personal log. When he returned, he began to eat a pie Lieutenant Jex baked for him. Soon after, Lieutenant Verne mentioned hearing a clicking noise, and Nedras questioned Lieutenant Jex about the symptoms of an allergic reaction, apparently thinking he was having one himself. His veins began to darken purple, and Lieutenant Verne initiated site-to-site sickbay transport.</div></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace"><div class="pre pre--multiline nohighlight">We arrived in sickbay, and Nedras’s condition worsened. Lieutenant Jex instructed all those not members of medical or science to exit. I stayed in sickbay both because of this request and because of previous experience in relevant chemistry courses at the Academy.
Nedras was unable to provide any information on his condition, but we know now- and we knew then- that it was due to the activation of his termination implant. A visiting medical officer from the nI’lraH suggested we put Nedras in stasis, and we did so. Soon after, Ensign Devereux returned to sickbay, asking about Nedras’ condition. They were informed by both Junior Petty Officer Otosle Eriflo and Lieutenant Jex that such information was confidential, but refused to leave. They presented to me, upon my request, a chemical formula on a PADD that they explained would help Nedras. We repeatedly asked them where they obtained it, but they could only tell us it was “classified”. The arguing escalated, before Lieutenant Jex ordered them out of sickbay, and Lieutenant Ramat’iklan confiscated their PADD with the formula on it. Lieutenant Junior Grade Saren R’Mor was also present by this time, and began to study the compound. 
At this point I contacted Commander T’Svai and informed her of the situation. It is my understanding that Lieutenant Verne also contacted Commander Yllescas as well. Lieutenant Ramat’iklan then requested all non-medical personnel leave sickbay, and we did so. Lieutenant Verne, Ensign Tan, and myself remained in reception until this point, with only Lieutenant Verne leaving before I made this log. 
I have been informed that Ensign Nedras is stable at this point in time, but all further knowledge on his condition is held by medical and in-depth queries about his status should be directed there.

Stardate: 155205.19
Subject: Esta/Qhaveid Mission

On stardate 155193, an away team consisting of myself, Lieutenant Sara Bjorge, Lieutenant Lokath Targesh, Lieutenant Drevas Kniel, Lieutenant Zulola Jex, Ensign Nedras, and Ensign Herne was called to the shuttle bay. There, we were debriefed by Lieutenant Bjorge- our mission was to locate the source of a large amount of particle emissions on the planet. We utilized Delta Flyer One to make our way to the planet, with Ensign Nedras piloting. Once on the planet, we immediately noticed that the tricorders were not functioning correctly, and I discovered that there was electrical tape blocking the scanning end of our tricorders. Meanwhile, a large beetle approached us, and remained with us for the entirety of the away mission.
We began to move through the jungle towards the source of the particles. After some time, we arrived at a group of structures built for a species much smaller than us, perhaps around two feet in size. They had not been inhabited for several hundreds of years. Scans indicated the particle was highest in density at a building seeming to be a laboratory. There was a door at the back of the building. Lieutenant Jex then put her head into the structure and reported there was an inscription in an unknown language on the door. I scanned it and sent it back up the Phoenix for translation. Petty Officer Duburmal was able to translate the inscription; it said “Authorized Entry Only: Particle Manufacturing Department”. Ensign Nedras then used his phaser to shoot open the door in the lab. We discovered it to be a lift, and scans revealed the density of the particle only increased as it went deeper. We set my tricorder to scan and sent it down in the lift.</div></span>

Many floors had no outstanding qualities and several contained computers and labs, while the bottom floor had the largest reading of particles thus far. Lieutenant Jex sent down an emptied hypospray to collect some of the particles. One of the computers in the lab was then turned on, and Lieutenant Targesh relayed continuous scans back to the Phoenix. Lieutenant Jex also removed one of the computers and desks from the lab. Before we left, Petty Officer Dubrumal once again contacted us with a translation of the computer scans: “Global Qhaveid Particle Manufacture Initiative: Bring Energy to Esta. Laboratory 12”. We then returned to the ship and made our way back to the Phoenix.
Upon our return to the Phoenix, I returned to research labs to upload data from tricorders. I then commed Lieutenant Jex to bring the computer to the lab. She arrived with the beetle from the planet in tow, explaining it had been beamed aboard by an unknown person. Ensign Nedras arrived with a flower from the planet that had appeared in the armoury. I then began the data upload from the computer, and took swabs from the beetle. After some time, the information was obtained from the computer (a full data readout is attached), including the status of the native species of Esta (the Qhaveid), the purpose of the laboratory, and detrimental nature of the particles. Ensign Nedras and I went to Commander T’Svai to discuss a second away mission to disrupt the particle production.</div></span>

We beamed back down to Esta through the deck seventeen pattern buffer, which had been modified by Lieutenant Commander Higgins and Lieutenant Xeya to shrink us down to the size of the buildings on the planet.
Once back on Esta, initial tricorder scans revealed no significant changes. We then entered the lab, and subsequently the lift. We went all the way down to the bottom level, an underground lab, and located the large machine at the center of the room which was producing the particle. Then, without consulting the rest of the team, Lieutenant Jex unplugged the machine. The machine began to spark, and scans indicated it was collapsing. Lieutenant Jex ordered us to the lift. Ensign Nedras and myself stayed behind against orders in an attempt to fix the machine, as it was producing an extremely large amount of particles which could have endangered the Qhaveid, and we had not had the time to fully examine it. The machine then exploded into failsafe containment. We were beamed back aboard Phoenix on the bridge, and remained two feet tall. We then beamed down through deck seventeen, and returned to our normal height. Commander Itesh met us there, and Lieutenant Jex gave him a recap of the mission. A nearby console then began to ding, and the Qhaveid gave us several messages of thanks for what we had done. 

Attached as stated is the data obtained from the first computer. The second has yet to be analyzed.

Lt. Sulvak, Ship&#39;s Veterinarian
Discovery of new species: A. Morgan

A previously unknown species was identified in the ship’s cargo bay on Deck 17. Transporter records indicated that the species was beamed onboard while in orbit of the planet Esta as part of ongoing non-critical malfunctions which the Phoenix experienced on 155198.55. The creature was anecdotally described as a marsupial and the visual record I was provided bore an uncanny resemblance to a winged version of Phascolarctos P. Cinereus.

A series of bait scents were prepared in order to trap and examine a representative of this species for the purposes of identification and humane removal from the vessel. I prepared a mixture consisting of .5 fl.oz. Prungi Scent-7 and .77 fl.oz. of Eucalyptus-7 which was infused into vegetable mass and set into a trap as bait. One of the animals responded immediately and was trapped for a biological scan.  The scan results are attached.

I designed a funnel-trap in order to begin capturing the remaining creatures. Prior to deploying the trap the entities which caused the transporter malfunction that resulted in the species arrival reversed the process. This removed the animals from the Phoenix and no further study could be conducted.

After a thorough search of the Federation Exobiology Database I have determined that this is a previously undocumented species. I have classified the creature in the manner listed below and selected ‘A. Morgan’ as its species in honor of Ensign Alyx Morgan who discovered and first reported the species to the science division.

Chordata
Mammalia
Marsupialia
Diprotodontia
