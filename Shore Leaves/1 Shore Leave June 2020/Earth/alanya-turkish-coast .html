                    <div class="markdown"><em>Handing in her letter of transfer to Starfleet Intelligence had gone better than she had thought, A’aehrel mused to herself as she stared out at the cerulean-blue water beyond. There was the lightest of breezes, the scent of sea water, the sun was at the perfect height so as to raise the temperature but not be an annoyance. The sound of the wind caught in the sails created a familiar rustling noise. It was an oddly calming effect. For the last ten or so years this had been her home – a beautiful vintage Beneteau Oceanis that she had restored herself as a project when she had ended up on Earth. If she was not out on an assignment somewhere then every day after work at Intelligence’s HQ she could be found here, beaming back aboard directly by utilising a modified pattern enhancer and being tapped into Intelligence’s vast transporter network. She would find somewhere to anchor or dock and head off for the day. It was amusing to listen to the flurry of recordings left over the radio from other ships trying to establish why and how this one vessel had been seemingly abandoned but was still in such good condition.</em> 

<em>Giving that transfer notice over to her boss had created an opportunity that she very rarely got; the chance to just sail freely. The Phoenix was on shore leave which meant that she had time to cruise down the coast to Alanya to where an old friend would take in her boat and ensure it was kept safe while she was off with Starfleet. He always did, bless his soul, the younger Romulan truly was helpful. It was very rare that she had</em> <em><strong>time</strong></em> <em>like this. Almost all of her waking hours were spent working, and the very few free days she had was spent moored, conducting maintenance or gathering up supplies. While the solar panels strategically positioned meant that there was enough power to keep everything running including a replicator, she far preferred fresh produce. Not as if she was going to be able to get that while aboard a starship, though.</em></div>

<em>That was going to be one of the few downsides. She had gotten so used to living off of the land in the past that it felt odd not to, even if it was just via purchasing proper groceries in the town. The last time she had been in Istanbul she had stocked up on fresh botanicals at least – they were all neatly packed into a wooden case which organised everything. That was more than definitely coming with her. It was quite likely that Starfleet valued comfort more than the Tal Shiar or Zhat Vash did but there was no way a replicator was ever going to live up to how</em> <em><strong>proper</strong></em> <em>tea tasted. It was unlikely to meet the same properties when it came to medicinal healing either.</em> 

<em>Heading back out aboard a starship once more was going to be strange. Now and again she ended up aboard one for certain lengths of time while conducting work with Intelligence, but being on an extended tour again… It had been years, to say the least. And the other major difference was that this was</em> <em><strong>Starfleet.</strong></em> <em>They had a completely different way of life. She had seen it whilst working with the Phoenix’s crew to continually hop back in time. The way they lived was so… Open. People were friendly. You could do as you pleased with your spare time – spare time was something you actually had. You had the freedom to decorate your quarters or go to the mess hall or chat openly with a superior officer instead of being threatened for doing such a thing. Their way of life was practically a luxury compared to that of her past. It was daunting, it was nerve-wracking; it was</em> <em><strong>exhilarating.</strong></em></div>

<em>A’aehrel was not usually one for emotion. Almost going through kolinahr had done that to her. While in the end she hadn’t gone through the procedure, instead being snatched up by Starfleet Intelligence, she still found it easier to remain stern-faced and only occasionally allow a hint of amusement or light-heartedness to shine through. It probably wasn’t healthy. She didn’t really care. No one had ever tried to talk her out of her ways before. Perhaps Starfleet might… Or perhaps she might end up changing that all on her own when exposed to this different sort of atmosphere. The prospect of the future was interesting. It wasn’t one that she had expected, that much was to be certain. Starfleet – proper Starfleet, aboard a ship once more… A ship that was not one that sailed upon the ocean, she mused as she placed a hand upon the winch handle to tighten the rope. Instead, she would be aboard a ship that sailed amongst the stars.</em> 

<em>Just upon the horizon now she could make out the shapes of other vessels cruising back and forth. This was it, then. She was going to hand over the yacht and head off to some sort of new chapter. The idea filled her with melancholy but somehow, simultaneously, with hope. Change would do her some good. And besides, there was no reason to be upset at leaving this way of life. It would practically be mimicked aboard a Federation starship and the Phoenix were known for being granted shore leave quite often as compensation for whatever mess they had dealt with this time. She would be back here soon enough; sailing down the coast with the breeze caught in her hair, hair which was down instead of tied back, allowing herself to feel that fleeting sense of emotion as the vessel cruised over the waves. And what was that emotion? Serenity, perhaps. Serenity when she did not have to worry about the past or present, and could instead look onwards to the future.</em>

Once securely anchored and berthed in place he practically vaulted over onto the surface of the main deck, fixing A’aehrel with a grin. He was only happy because he would be in charge of the yacht while she was gone. That included taking it out for a cruise now and again. She wasn’t going to let the poor thing sit idly in a dock somewhere now, was she? S’Haerrhiy may have been young but he was enthusiastic, and the young harbourmaster knew how to do his job well. It was the least she could do to repay him, considering he was going to be ensuring nothing happened to the yacht while she was away.</em> 

“Jolan’tru, Skipper!” <em>She hated it when he called him that. He knew she hated it and that was exactly why he did it every time.</em> “So, what are we thinking, you going to take her up into drydock or are you after a permanent mooring, or…“ 

“The designated moor, S’Haerrhiy. We have already discussed-“ 

“I know we’ve discussed it, Skipper, but you know what it’s like around here! Busy place, folk trying to Mediterranean moor, not a lot of space all of the time and there’s no point wasting a berth with a yacht that ain’t being-“ 

<em>A’aehrel merely sighed and looked at the young Romulan pointedly.</em> “I will give you 70 GPL and free access to sail the yacht when and where you want if you get me that moor.”

                    <div class="markdown"><em>She was met by an incredulous blink before the grin started to spread across the man’s face. In an instant he had vaulted back over try land with a call of ‘let me sort the paperwork!’ A’aehrel had merely sighed and headed below the deck in order to gather up the last of her things. The majority of her belongings would stay here but there were a couple of items that both her self and Intelligence would rather other people did not get their hands on. Her finely-organised container of botanicals for tinctures and infusions was carefully strapped to the back of a rucksack, the rest of her belongings inside. Stepping off the boat and looking back upon it almost felt melancholy but at the same time, she was hopeful. Change was necessary. You had to be like the tide, one with the moon; it meant you did not get swept away or left behind.</em> 

<em>A’aehrel cast a last glance back at the boat before heading down to meet with Harry, giving a nod to the other workers milling around as she went. A lot of her time ended up being spent here – she had gotten to know the people at least by name. Now she was going to have to get to know an entirely different crew… And she was actually looking forward to it. Those she had spoken to had mostly been pleasant so far. It was going to be a pleasure to get to work with them and see the stars once more… And perhaps she could help to keep them out of more trouble, seeing as how it was all they seemed to find themselves landing in.</em> 

<em>Harry had organised everything perfectly. With bag on her back and wind in her hair she was soon headed into town to the public-access transporter. The scent of the sea air was still there – comforting, welcoming, but encouraging change as she requested the beam-up to the Phoenix beyond.</em></div>
