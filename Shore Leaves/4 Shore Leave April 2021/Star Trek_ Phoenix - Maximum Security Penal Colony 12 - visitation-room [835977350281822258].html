She was here for one purpose and one purpose only - not to dawdle or delay for any reason whatsoever.</em>

<em>A late night in her office, mulling over the situation, had turned into an investigation - this one private, her own, off the record, so to speak - and that had turned into facts she couldn’t deny about previous events and herself and, most importantly, the Iconians. She didn’t trust them to be consistent (they were the enemy, after all, and seemed to change their tactics with every encounter), but she was familiar enough with the basic facts about them to know that something didn’t quite line up. Something that had <strong>serious</strong> consequences.</em>

<em>Her movements went unrestricted by the nearby guards, a quick glance at each of them making it evident that she was <strong>not</strong> an escaping prisoner. Not that she was wearing anything like what a prisoner would be wearing, but with the history of some of the people held in this facility? They couldn’t be blamed for being paranoid. Hell, Coleridge herself was paranoid, even if in her mind it was just thoroughness.</em>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace"><em>The arrival of the prisoner that Coleridge was here to see was announced by the flickering to life of a holofield which cut the table directly in half. The only indication of its activity was the faint hum of energy as it powered on – it was rather lucky that Coleridge had opted to stick to her own side of the table, considering how it would have activated at the presence of any misplaced fingers. Despite the armed guards who stood at each entrance – one entrance at the officer’s side of the room, one entrance at the prisoner’s – precautions were still taken. You couldn’t expect less from a prison designated as maximum security, really.</em> 

<em>The activation of the holofield was followed by the dull click of doors unlocking and the hydraulic hiss of them then opening. It was flanked by another two guards that the ‘enemy’, as Coleridge seemed determined to think of him as, entered the visiting room. Clad in the white prison uniform which was designed to contrast with the gunmetal grey of the building’s interior, the ‘enemy’ looked more akin to a ghost than anything. The uniform almost seemed to be the same colour of his skin, pallor even worse than usual, and standing out were numerous dark bruises which lined both sides of his face.</em> 

<em>It was hardly the refined look that he was used to conveying, Harris tweed and a neatly trimmed beard swapped out for an appearance which was decidedly ragged, but the least that he could do was keep his posture as perfect as possible as he crossed the distance between the door and the long table which dominated the otherwise empty area of the visiting room. It was with his back straight and hands held neatly upon the table that he took his seat, tired eyes somehow still conveying an analytical gaze as he looked to the person who had arrived to visit – and how he would have loved to have the first word, but the presence of the armed guards behind him made him well aware that he should do otherwise.</em></span>

Ordinarily, she would have jumped straight to the point, alerted him of what she’d found and the implications of it and all, but there was a bit of investigating to do, to read the man’s character. This was an opportunity to get a good, long look at his body language. (Coincidentally, she’d started staring, analyzing every detail from the specifics of the pattern of his spots to his posture, to his breathing pattern, and was cross-referencing them with her memory of the footage from the museum). Theo smiled that mostly-fake, condescending smile.</em> “I trust that they’ve treated you well?”

<em>It wasn’t that she didn’t actually care or was willingly ignoring the evidence, of course. Like she always insisted, she wasn’t a savage. But the niceties were very much so a delay as she focused more on the bruises and the pallor than the conversation, and she put little effort into hiding it. There wasn’t a pattern to the marks… They weren’t inflicted by fists, that was certain. The angle wasn’t right for them to be self-inflicted, and they were too broad, anyway. Various ages.... Theo computed the details, quite quickly arriving at the conclusion that no one had bothered to catch him when he had had seizures. Had they not cared enough to so much as use a dermal regenerator? Really, why was he put in potentially dangerous situations? That wasn’t how the Federation was supposed to treat their prisoners. That was inhumane.</em>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace"><em>From the moment they had met, Giles had decided that he very much did not like the way that Coleridge enunciated her words. It was some sort of ingrained trick of deception, he was certain, utilised so a person’s tone never conveyed how they actually felt. Even for him and his former years in the field it seemed almost impossible to pick apart Coleridge’s tone. In normal circumstances it would have thoroughly annoyed him. Today two other states overrode that proclivity for frustration: tiredness, firstly, and curiosity for a second – curiosity in regards to exactly what the division head of MADD was doing here. He was certain that this was hardly a social call.</em> 

<em>To the guards in the room this interaction may have been either entirely amusing or completely perplexing considering how the two seemed so intent upon an in-depth analysis of the visual appearance of one another, determined that surface appearances could tell you far more than what you could initially see. That cloy smile of Coleridge’s was picked up upon, as was the way that she noted something down in her notepad – physical paper, he would have called her pretentious if it wouldn’t have turned him into a hypocrite – and despite him picking out as many details as possible, it hardly answered the question of why the woman was here. …How dire.</em> 

<em>It was with a voice which was perhaps somewhat gravelly or scratchy that he replied, and it was with distaste that he found himself doing so. Giles was well aware that any little detail such as that would be picked up upon and he had no doubts that Coleridge had her analytical skills sharpened to a fine point; she would likely instantaneously pick up on the evidence that he had barely spoken during his duration of time here. When you were put against someone such as Coleridge in the Intelligence field then existence became a convoluted game of investigation and stoicism – and so far, Giles was undeniably losing.</em>

It seemed, for example, that the man had hardly said a word in weeks or months, judging by the state of his voice, or that he desperately needed a glass of water - she would have considered the latter more deeply if it weren’t for the fact that she was certain that prisoners were never deprived of enough food and water, even if they were evidently not treated appropriately after having seizures. Was she certain? Another moment was taken to visually scan him, looking for signs of dehydration or malnutrition. It wasn’t motivated by guilt, of course. Absolutely not. There was no reason to feel guilty. It was simply ensuring that Federation regulations were being upheld.</em>

“As I’m sure you’re well aware,” <em>she finally began,</em> “I can’t force you to share the details of Laika’s training, or the tasks she performs.

They also claimed that Laika utilized her training to prevent them from being injured. Is this something that Laika is capable of?” <em>she asked, keeping up that same vague tone and offering no reason whatsoever for her questions, verbal or otherwise.

You could hardly expect anything else considering it was Coleridge who had arrived – both her status as MADD’s division lead and her own reputation made it easy to jump to that conclusion. Giles had been more than ready for some sort of rapid-fire question-and-answer session of everything that hadn’t been said during the initial investigation back upon Earth. Maybe something had happened and they had decided that he was a suspect in the matter, and so this visitation was set to be an effort to implicate him further in more crimes that definitely were not conducted by himself.</em> 

<em>He would hardly have known if something had happened upon Earth – or anywhere in the Federation for that matter. For some, punishment came from the lack of freedom; the basic amenities, the being bored out of your skull of seeing the same four walls day in and day out. For some it was the lack of social interaction that was not fraught with danger, considering how there was always someone ready to fight (in a maximum security prison such as this one there was no getting away from the brutes, it seemed). For Giles, punishment had largely came in the fact that he was so out of the loop. For someone who prided themselves on the acquisition of foreign Intelligence and always knowing what was going on, not even knowing what was happening within the Federation’s own walls had been a complete and utter nightmare.</em>

Ordinarily, Coleridge wouldn’t have cared what Giles thought of her, but this was completely ridiculous.</em> “<strong>Mr. <em>Giles</em></strong>, you don’t really think I would hurt <em>a dog</em>, do you?” <em>she asked sarcastically before mumbling something similar to, ‘I swear to God, this is madness,’ - it was hard to tell, with her voice slightly muffled by the holofield - and shaking her head.</em> “Laika is <strong>perfectly</strong> safe.”

<em>Rather than keep elaborating on what she’d been intending to say, Theo pulled out a small PADD she’d tucked away in the inner pocket of her coat.</em> “Upon revisiting the investigation into your case, I had the opportunity to view footage I hadn’t had access to at the time- Drop the field,” <em>she explained, interrupting herself to address the guards behind her with a bit of impatient annoyance.</em> “Yes, I’m sure. Drop the field.” <em>With that done, she slid the device onto the other side of the table, leaving it square in the middle; Coleridge had seen what she needed to see and didn’t particularly expect to be attacked. On the screen was the footage Giles had already seen, <strong>and</strong> an additional camera angle not seen by the Trill before. The latter quite clearly showed a young woman tripping and falling maybe five meters away from the Trill and his dog… and Laika not reacting in the slightest.</em> “Does this strike you as unusual?”

It wasn’t even the thought of Laika being harmed that got under his skin; it was Coleridge’s mannerisms and wording and</em> <em><strong>everything</strong></em> <em>that she did. Words could not express how much this woman frustrated him – but that was likely the whole point, was it not, just part of her technique. The sooner you annoyed a person so much that they broke, the sooner that you got results.</em> 

<em>He would have continued his retort had it not been for the woman calling for the holofield to be dropped. This brought multiple layers of surprise; for one, that she was trusting him enough to lower the field – had she not been so vehemently against him and intent upon having him locked away for the remainder of this lifetime? For two, there was the fact that she had ‘revisited’ his case. Why would she do that in the first place? Had Coleridge had her doubts from the start? If anyone knew anything about Giles it was the fact that he could be very easily drawn in – curiosity was his flaw – and it was as such that he pushed aside the frustration and dislike and found himself intrigued.</em> 

<em>Squinting a little (how he missed his glasses, having lost them at some stage and not having had the gall to ask if they could be replaced) he watched the footage upon the PADD. The location was obvious; his old place of ‘employment’ within that museum on Rigel III had hardly changed over the years. He watched the image of himself but not himself for a moment before he took in the wider details, looking at the people around them – and then he watched the woman fall. So</em> <em><strong>that</strong></em> <em>was the reason why Coleridge was so interested – she had noticed a discrepancy.</em> <em><strong>Finally.</strong></em>

But, frankly, Giles could think what he wanted - she didn’t care, or she told herself she didn’t care. She did her job and she did it well, and that was all that mattered. If the Trill was so determined to paint her as an enemy, then, to be perfectly honest, <strong>so what?</strong> Why should she care? Giles annoyed Coleridge as much as she did him. (He did have that tendency to match her retorts and snark.)</em> 

“Clearly, I <em>do</em> know how to, given that I’m here to coordinate your release,” <em>she said plainly, condescension implied rather than made explicit by tone. She intended to remain civil, after all, even if he did seem to be calmed <strong>and</strong> intrigued by her discovery. The change in his posture was fascinating - and slightly guilt-inducing, though Coleridge didn’t let that show. In their previous conversations, she’d seen him angry, argumentative, and annoyed, among other things, but never had she noted anything that made him seem <strong>ragged</strong>. Maybe that was a trait common among ex-Section 31 agents, the front of strained manners covering a far more gritty persona and a willingness to get one’s hands dirty to get a job done. Then again, maybe the Trill was just tired - that made sense too, given where he’d been for the past few months, and the fact that he looked and sounded so. A note was taken (mentally, not physically) to look for other signs in the future, to build a better sense of just <strong>who</strong> this man was, as opposed to who he presented himself as.</em>

In their previous interaction when this investigation had been ongoing, the woman had seemed hell-bent upon sending him to jail and determined that the footage could not have lied. It was almost odd to see that she had completely changed her vote now. Giles could hardly complain about such a thing considering how it was a step in the right direction (and a step closer to him getting out,) but the contrast in viewpoints that the MADD division head had held and once held was… Striking, to say the least.</em> 

<em>He would have at least commented on the latter statements had he not been interrupted by a dog rather rapidly darting towards him from across the room. No efforts at stoicism or keeping up a certain fa&#231;ade were going to be retained right now – instead it was with a legitimate smile that he regarded the dog as she drew near. For a moment it seemed as if Laika may have jumped up with paws straight to his shoulders, but despite her energy she was well trained and knew better. Instead she almost immediately placed her head upon Giles’s knee, whimpering softly as if to chastise him for having been gone for that length of time.</em> 

<em>It was in between quick and quiet statements to the dog – the usual “whose a good girl,” “I’ve missed you,” – coupled with the ruffling of Laika’s fur and constantly providing her with attention that he did glance back to Coleridge to reply.</em> “The issue is, then- how exactly this footage and its false image was created. When I looked over the footage myself the system picked on no indication that it was holographically generated, but somehow it seems entirely realistic.

As the dog came rushing in, Theo took the opportunity to analyze, instead of reacting directly to the joyful-looking reunion. An excitable-but-disciplined dog, as well trained as initially assumed to be, Laika was clearly sly the way to Giles’ heart, given the earlier surge of protectiveness, and the way his whole attitude seemed to become a little more personable once the dog had arrived. The reverse seemed to be true as well, though that information was obviously not as useful as the one that came before it.</em>

Gone were the days of having to constantly be on your guard around Section 31, and gone were the days of fearing the same at Intelligence. When he had first joined – joined couldn’t really be counted considering it was more of a ‘sought refuge’ – everyone had the potential to be an enemy despite them being in the same organisation. Over the years this had changed. Giles had found that he no longer had to keep up the continuous stoic front, the subtle lies and constant deceptions. He trusted those within Intelligence – and he</em> <em><strong>should</strong></em> <em>have been able to trust Coleridge from the start.</em> 

<em>In that case, perhaps the issue was not with him, but it was with</em> <em><strong>her.</strong></em> <em>Had she never found that sense of peace amongst her peers, the one that he had managed to settle into over years of running the department?
