The attempt to make her leave may well have not been directed towards herself either. It could be a subconscious reflection of a desire to rid himself of this alternate personality. After all,</em> <em><strong>it</strong></em> <em>was what truly didn’t belong.</em> 

<em>The familiar opening notes of that song did manage to catch her off guard. Suddenly aware of both reality and Dunamis’s own mindscape her hands had dropped, staggering – it took her all of her effort to drag herself back into the image his brain was projecting and not lose sight of it.</em>

<em>It was just typical that he would know the easiest way to attempt to forcibly remove her. This had just made everything even more difficult. It did not matter, though. Perseverance was the key. Once Dunamis was alright then she could face whatever new consequences lay in wait for her. She could already predict them. Maybe it would finally happen this time.</em> 

<em>As vision cleared she caught sight of the door. Chained – like his own personality, perhaps, or attempting to lock away the alternate one behind the steel. The wood of the door could be broken down. It had to be himself, then. It was himself behind the door.</em> 

<em>”Dunamis, darling,” she dared to speak. “It’s not me that you want rid of. I’m here to help you, alright? It’s time to bring you back. The real you. You’re going to have to focus for me. Focus on yourself, on who</em> <em><strong>you</strong></em> <em>are. I know that you’ve been hurt. I know that you’ve been locked away. But we’re going to get you out. We’re going to help you.”</em></div>

As if by magic the book that K&#39;Pora had been ripping pages out of flipped open, and the scraps of paper flew into it, pages mending. The book itself remained on the floor, however. The incessant background music slowly petered out, leaving her alone with the two of them in silence once again. The apparitions themselves regarded her silently, once, before casting their gaze to the oaken door, where the chains remained fixed in place.</em> 

&quot;Are you sure you want to go in there, aunt Phen? You might not like what you see.&quot; <em>&#39;Kennox&#39; informed her.</em> 

&quot;He&#39;s hardly worth saving. What kind of leader makes assumptions about his followers before they&#39;ve had a chance to prove themselves?&quot; <em>&#39;K&#39;Pora&#39; added.</em> 

<em>Okay, maybe he hadn&#39;t really heard them both talk a lot. Their voices sounded about right but their inflections and speech were off. But for what it was they represented well enough the feelings he kept bottled up inside; Fear. Regret. Feelings that wandered his mind every so often, messed up the cozy, warm space from which he drew strength. Each and every time he&#39;d picked the books up, restored them and put them back where they belonged. But not this time. Not fully.</em> 

<em>She could hear something else now. Voices. <strong>A lot</strong> of voices. Voices that escaped under the chained door, drifted out, carried on the air. Was there air in this space? Was that even relevant? Eh, who cares? Laughing, chattering, maybe a few hard thumps and groans of pain - groans that distinctly belonged to Dunamis. The contents of the conversation, or conversation<strong>s</strong> going on behind the door were unclear at this time, though she would be able to tell that the tone was mocking. Some seemed vaguely familiar to her as well.</em>

&quot;We came from there. How much fun it is in there!&quot; <em>&#39;K&#39;pora&#39; gave a snort of laughter.</em> &quot;Why don&#39;t you go join in?&quot;<span class="chatlog__edited-timestamp" title="25-Jun-20 05:40 AM">(edited)</span></div>

The image of this room had already began to fade to black at the edges, every sound and noise becoming more distant as the call of reality crept in. She had been right when she presumed this was not going to be a simple task - and was going to be one that she really shouldn&#39;t undertake.</em> 

<em>Another moment to analyse the change. This felt like being forced to pick apart a novel for every detail and its symbolism. Not as if she usually minded but in this case she did. She simply did not have the time. The pages suddenly being returned to the book was likely an improvement, as well. Did its place on the floor still indicate its ability to be trod upon, perhaps, unwilling to properly be restored to life? There could have been numerous interpretations. And then there was still that door now coupled with a cacophony of sound from beyond. Sound... Something that she wasn&#39;t supposed to hear, this mental projection something that she was not supposed to see. Trawling through mental mindscapes in comparison to the reality of the real world was agonising. The contrast was too great. Her brain was no longer equipped to physically handle these two senses and yet here she was,</em> <em><strong>having to.</strong></em> <em>Time was limited</em> 

<em>&quot;Dunamis, I know that it feels like you&#39;ve been chained. You&#39;re going to have to realise that you have the ability of fighting back. You can break free of those chains. I need you to take the first step for me, okay?</em> <em><strong>You</strong></em> <em>have to do this, and I know that you can. Just focus. All of that emotion is what makes you</em> <em><strong>you.</strong></em> <em>Don&#39;t let anyone else control you. You need to remember who you are.&quot;</em>

<em>The plea made sense. As soon as there was a projection of the two different sides of himself that was when she could step in and erase it. The first part just had to be down to him.</em></div>

The apparitions of Kennox and K&#39;Pora looked at each other and nodded, shaking their heads. &quot;She&#39;s sure.&quot; &quot;Same old aunt Phen.&quot; And with that they flickered and were gone, and the chains latching the door shut cracked, fell away in pieces on the floor. The door swung open... revealing the bridge of the Phoenix, which appeared to be filled with people and in a state of utter disrepair. At least a thousand people, all dressed in section 31 black. How they all fit was a mystery. The voices heard were familiar because the <strong>people</strong> were familiar: the crew of the Phoenix, both past and present. Talos, Logan, Mackenzie. Zanmar, Korvas, Blanche, Ezran, Kun and more, everyone who he&#39;d served with in recent years and cared about.</em> 

<em>But more than that she saw also the six members of the away team whom he&#39;d nearly sent down and killed by sheer negligence. They too were dressed in section 31 black, but their expressions were blank, pallor sickly, eyes glassed over and empty. The three security officers he&#39;d killed in a mind-controlled state were present too, in the same undead state as their compatriots. Like they&#39;d been raised from the dead. All of them seemed to be mercilessly attacking someone in the centre, some gloating, others goading and laughing. From the centre of the impossibly large mob came whimpers of pain and groans. As if their victim was ready to succumb, but would not.</em>

<em>In making the poor decisions that he had, he felt that he&#39;d let down the legacy of the ship, a legacy that extended to the people who had, and continued to, give the ship it&#39;s name, for without them they&#39;d be nowhere. And this was the extent of his guilt at having failed them. How crushing.</em><span class="chatlog__edited-timestamp" title="25-Jun-20 09:21 AM">(edited)</span></div>

At the same time, though, it made her wonder what must have happened in his past to make a grown man so sensitive to name-calling and the sort of bullying that a child might throw around. Surely there must be something else behind it. An adult wouldn&#39;t be so sensitive to such a minor thing if not.</em> 

<em>They had been over this as well before. The concepts of mistakes or wronging people or carrying out actions that were not actually his own. The trauma of being forced to watch while he, not being in control, had to carry out such attacks would undoubtedly be difficult to move past. What Section 31 had done to him was going to be difficult to move past. This fight was up to him, though. She couldn&#39;t fix everything for him. She couldn&#39;t drive out these images and thoughts and suddenly make him who he was again. That was his own fight. She could only guide him - and if some forced alternate consciousness did decide to present itself, then she could remove it.</em> 

&quot;I know this is difficult. I know that these people hurt you - and that you hurt them. You have to focus, though. What they are doing is not real, it never was. It has always been part of your imagination. No one would chastise you like this. We all make mistakes, we all want to help one another learn from them and use it as an opportunity for growth. You have to realise that.&quot;</div>

In his hand was held his commbadge, tightly, knuckles white from the effort. Like a source of comfort or strength.
