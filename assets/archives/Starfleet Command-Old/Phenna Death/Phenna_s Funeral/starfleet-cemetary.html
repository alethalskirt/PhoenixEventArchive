                    <div class="markdown">&quot;Dear colleagues, friends, fellow officers of Starfleet. 

Today we mourn the passing of Fleet Admiral Phenna Ephrix - former Surgeon-General of Starfleet Medical, counsellor and friend to all. 

When one thinks of her, a few words remain front and center of one’s thoughts: kind, humble, loving, caring, warm, understanding, patient. Traits which she had and exhibited in abundance - and then some. She was a veritable embodiment of those values,  and that remained an ever-apparent fact, right up til the day of her death. For her there was no one unworthy of her love, kindness or her help - only that they were in need, and she was only glad to give of herself.

All of us present here know that she gave generously of herself to others; of her time, love, attention and care - right up til the day of her passing. Even in the twilight days of her life, she chose to do what she did best: to help others and bring them life and light. Others might have thought to do otherwise, but she chose to give the last moments of her life to others. For that, we salute her.&quot; </div>

I myself have had her counsel several times. In each and every encounter, all the traits I spoke about were readily apparent. Never once did she fail to remind me that I am not alone as I walk this path in life - that there are others who share the journey with me always. My most poignant encounter, however, took place just a few months ago. 

<em>He paused here for a moment, feeling a ball of emotion expand in his throat and making it feel tight and dry.</em> 

&quot;It had been a month after a particularly stressful mission. I was recuperating in Starfleet Medical - lost, feeling hopeless, thinking of leaving this part of my life behind. My intentions were, for the better, not to be. She visited me then and helped me re-find my direction. She showed me that there remained hope over the horizon - and to grasp it, I first needed to run towards it with my hands, mind and heart open. She helped me to become who I am today, to relight the fire that kept me going before - and for that I shall ever be in her debt. 

Words alone cannot adequately pay tribute to her life or her legacy, for they are so great, so beautiful and so fully lived as to be truly singular. I would even call them legendary. We all know that there will not be another Phenna Ephrix. Therefore, the greatest tribute that we can give, together, is in deed. To be kind, to care, to love and to support those around us, and in so doing keep her memory alive. To be Starfleet, as it should be. A portion of what she put into the universe around her now returned. I believe that is all she would have asked for from us in return, if at all, even after a life spent giving so much and asking for nothing in return.&quot; </div>

&quot;If she can hear us now, and I believe in some way she can - Admiral, on behalf of the crew of the U.S.S. Phoenix, let me take this moment to convey our deepest, sincerest gratitude. Words cannot express how grateful we are to you for all that you have done for us. All those who you have helped and who have known you are gathered here today to pay their respects in these precious final few moments - and the outpouring of love, gratitude and sorrow from the rest of the fleet says it all. Rest in peace, Phenna, knowing that you leave behind a universe, a Starfleet and a Federation greatly changed for the better by your actions. We are all in your debt. May you find what you could not in life, in the existence that awaits beyond ours.&quot; 

<em>He paused there, stifling a sob that built up in the base of his throat. Just a few more words. Come now. Finish off and you can handle the rest out of sight of the others. He took a deep breath, steeling himself for the closure.</em> 

&quot;Until we meet again, among the stars.&quot; 

<em>Following which, he gave a choked &#39;thank you&#39; to the crowd, and stepped off the podium, feeling his throat tighten as he joined the crowd below. Don&#39;t cry. Don&#39;t you dare cry. Not here and not now. You have a crew that <strong>needs</strong> you.</em> </div>

&quot;What we do in our lives is up to us to decide, and Fleet Admiral Phenna Ephrix chose what she would do in hers. She chose to care for others. In one way or another, almost all of you here will have been positively affected by her actions. Be it directly, or indirectly. She may have healed your physical wounds, she may have healed your mental wounds, or at least put you on the path to recovery, but everywhere she went, she helped someone.

She, like everyone, faced hardship in her life, from the beginning to the end, but she carried on helping people regardless. She was selfless, truly. As a Starfleet Officer she put others before herself, as all should do, but she went far beyond the requirements of her position.

By the beginning of 2400 she founded the United Federation Humanitarian Committee, an organisation dedicated to helping people in times of emergency and crisis. Since their founding, they have responded to countless situations, from natural disasters to a starship crash.

2477 was what I can only describe as a difficult and harsh year for a lot of people here today, and for Phenna as well. From one hardship to another, from one incident to the next. I could list off every incident, but that&#39;s not why we&#39;re here. Phenna went through a lot this last year, taking one hit after another, after another, after another. She became hemiplegic and lost her sight after trying to help someone mentally, and then when she used a previously created telepathic relay in a time of crisis despite the damage she previously sustained, and she ended up completely deafblind. <span class="chatlog__edited-timestamp" title="07-Nov-20 06:28 PM">(edited)</span></div>

She underwent restorative surgery as a result of the damage caused by her use of her abilities, which made several medical professionals, among others, start questioning how her brain had seemingly healed itself. Well through word of mouth, one person after another slowly learned the answers to the questions, including the Tal Shiar. They didn’t want to miss the opportunity to get their hands on someone who was part Q... So they kidnapped her.

The crew of the USS Phoenix managed to rescue her, but damage had already been done. The organisation had already managed to use Phenna’s powers maliciously and against her will to deal devastation to Mol’Rihan. Thankfully, however, and once again showing her true nature, she used her now obvious powers to fix that which had been done by the Tal Shiar. She restored New Romulus, and resurrected those that had fallen during those heinous acts.

Unfortunately life for Phenna slowly started ending after that, and it was only just over two months between the aforementioned event and the first of November when she sadly passed away. She was 189 Earth years old. Life can be harsh, sometimes way too harsh. We can’t control nor choose what happens to us, we can only choose what we do, and Fleet Admiral Phenna Ephrix definitely chose the right things to do, at least in my opinion.

She was a great Fleet Admiral, a great doctor, a great counsellor, and a great friend. She will be dearly missed by us all. May she rest in peace.&quot; <span class="chatlog__edited-timestamp" title="07-Nov-20 06:29 PM">(edited)</span></div>

The half betazoid joined trill stepped up to the podium like she’d done far too many times before, in this life and in the prior ones. But this time she could feel the mourning and the sadness and it weighed like a boulder pushes to the bottom of the ocean. A choked breath escaped her lips as she began to speak, her black and glassy eyes glossing over the crowd.</em> “Fleet Admiral Ephrix was by no means the type of person you’d meet on any given day.  And in my 532 years of continued life on Trill and elsewhere in the stars, I have yet to meet anyone even half like her. I doubt I ever will and that’s okay. The qualities she possessed were unmatched in their entireties. She lived, she saw, she met, she learned, she grew, and she kept growing. She changed, she laughed, she helped, she healed, she understood. Phenna understood so much. She understood my fear at the prospect of failing and the second I saw the plate of cookies on my desk the first day I arrived for my new posting. And the rest of the many things she understood weren’t simple by any means at all, there are certain complexities that only she could explain or comprehend. I would’ve loved to hear all of them, but time is short and life is fleeting. So as we mourn and grieve, her kind words and kinder actions remain exactly as they were in memory. Thank you.” <em>Morena nodded with a choked sob as she descended back to her seat, her black eyes closing briefly in an attempt to calm herself from her emotions and the emotions of those around her.</em> </div>

All those words were so, so little compared to the real person, though. I couldn&#39;t help but feel little, next to this legend, and yet... yet, I didn&#39;t. She was just that person who could wash your doubts like that, y&#39;know? That kindness and support and caring and understanding and- and all those things that made her Phenna Ephrix. I can only try to be as good as she was, but that didn&#39;t mean I won&#39;t try to do exactly that. She believed in me when I wasn&#39;t, believed in everyone and in their kindness. It&#39;d be an honor to walk in her steps and pursue her hopes and path for as long as I&#39;ll live, and I&#39;d like to think that- no, I know that I&#39;m not the only one who think so.
