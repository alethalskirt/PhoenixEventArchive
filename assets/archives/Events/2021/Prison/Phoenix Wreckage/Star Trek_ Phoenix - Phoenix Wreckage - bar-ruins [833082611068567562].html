It was hard to tell where the bar began and ended, really, considering how one of the walls towards the hallway had been folded over and mangled. Tables (or what was left of them, as numerous had been broken entirely) were strewn here and there in the section that must have been the remainder of the open seating area. The chandelier which had once hung from the ceiling in a rather pretentious way of spicing the place up and making it</em> <em><strong>not</strong></em> <em>seem like the bar upon a starship had wound up on the floor, splintered into countless pieces. Shards of crystal glass had been scattered upon its impact to the ground. In the glimmers of light which shone in through areas of the hull which had been pierced, it created a cascade of rainbows here and there where it interacted with the shattered glass.</em> 

<em>The glass was not only from the chandelier, of course, but also from the numerous broken bottles which had not survived the crash. Some smart people out there chose reinforced bottles which would withstand something like this, knowing that a ship getting into a skirmish could result in a heavy loss of merchandise. Others were either too lazy to invest in such a design - or they were too pretentious, claiming that it spoiled the drink somehow. What</em> <em><strong>did</strong></em> <em>spoil the drink was its bottle being smashed and the contents winding up on the floor - what a bloody waste.</em>

There was the dark scent of berries, plum - red wine, a Human favourite. Beneath it was the strangely bold, syrupy smell of Ferengi rum - so rarely made, and such a waste. Now and again if you inhaled deeply the scent of something more clinical and sharp which burned at the back of your nostrils and throat. Most would have thought it would be too clinical to drink, but some species would prove you otherwise and down it in one.</em> 

<em>Amidst the rubble - lamenting the loss of the merchandise - was not the bartender, surprisingly. The figure was too tall to be a Ferengi and the mess of grey-white hair - currently tied back - certainly confirmed otherwise. They appeared to have navigated to the area which was once the store behind the bar&#39;s main section. The glimmers of light from the discarded glass illuminated a silhouette and caught off a further bottle of alcohol, this one being held up to the nearest source of light itself as the figure squinted at the charred label.</em> &quot;Not telling me what you are does not help anyone,&quot; <em>a low voice grumbled with displeasure as the person tried to make out the writing.</em> &quot;How may bets that the Ferengi would have watered you down, hm?

I thought you would be the same, Starfleet.&quot; <em>He stopped for a moment, those two beady, crab-like eyes regarding the Cardassian again for a brief second. Evidently, not everyone fell into the stereotype that the Federation were all uptight and pompous. But then again... Maybe the Cardassian hadn&#39;t been brought up within the Federation. They were always so militaristic, though, Cardassians. This one was more personable and... &#39;Down to Earth,&#39; believed the phrase went. How interesting.</em> 

&quot;I&#39;d complain about your bartender&#39;s organisation but something tells me that it wasn&#39;t him so much as everything becoming disorganised in the crash. I would have made an attempt to organise before delving into a search, but...&quot; <em>He made a vague gesture with his hands, indicating, well, everything.</em> &quot;It would have taken a lifetime, and I doubt we have much time at all before the Iconians catch up to us. So why not just search <em>now</em> and find something useful in the here and now instead of having to wait, hm?&quot; <em>At that, something caught his eye, and after a misplaced step and stumbling for a second he managed to extract something from amidst the rubble of the bar. The shape of the bottle was very distinct.</em> &quot;Here you are, Starfleet. <em>Kanar.</em>&quot;</span>

<em>The glasses were placed on the flattest possible surface and he reached a hand out for the kanar, which he could practically taste already.

It was hardly one designed to empathise - the relatable nature was there, but it was far more of a &#39;I physically felt that&#39; than a &#39;oh ouch, I hope they&#39;re alright.&#39; So much for Nausicaan bedside manner, it seemed, which was ironic considering the title that he was about to introduce himself as when prompted by the Starfleet officer... Parlac,they had said.</em> 

&quot;I&#39;m afraid I don&#39;t know of these &#39;Hebitian Gods,&#39; Starf- <em>Parlac</em>, nor of what &#39;gettles&#39; are, but at least one thing is easily remedied - we <em>remove</em> this alcohol from here and we <em>do</em> take it to somewhere that it can be consumed. Simple.&quot; <em>The statement might have been interpreted as sarcastic if he hadn&#39;t sounded completely legitimate. How couldn&#39;t he be? He would give any answer and subsequently find any way out of here with this merchandise in tow if it meant he got to</em> <em><strong>drink it.</strong></em> <em>It would hardly be the same as indulging in fine spirits or creating the perfect cocktail exactly to his liking, but... It was something, and something was better than nothing. Part of him warned that he may well need to curb his enthusiasm a little... The Klingons found his joviality at the prospect of drink to be rather amusing, but Starfleet may well just pin him as a drunkard and be done with it.</em> 

&quot;And as for me,&quot; <em>he stated whilst handing over the bottle of kanar to the Cardassian who had held out their hand for it,</em> &quot;SuvwI&#39; wa&#39;DIch, Doctor, or just Cherow - whichever one you would prefer.

It is no longer illegal and there are many followers of the Oralian Way now-- that being said, calling on their names is more a sort of... turn of phrase than anything else. I personally don&#39;t adhere to the Way, but it&#39;s a habit I picked up from my ada.&quot; <em>Parlac gathered up the bottles he&#39;d found and started to head for the door-- carefully, so as not to risk anything happening to the bottles or his knees.</em> &quot;At any rate, you are most correct. The arboretum has life support and an airlock, which means we can shed these horrible things and have a decent drink-- or at least as close to a decent drink as possible under the circumstances. Shall we, doctor?&quot; <em>He waited in the doorway, clearly ready to cut his security sweep short for purposes of kanar consumption.</em>

<em>At the back of his mind, Parlac knew that his personal, admittedly nerdy fascination with alcohol was likely a far sight from the way this Nausicaan viewed the stuff. However, it also seemed unlikely that he would judge the chief wanting a taste of home, and that was more than enough-- even if they had to find a dark corner of the arboretum to partake, they were going to drink kanar and forget, even for a moment, that they were stuck on a wrecked ship in the middle of a wasteland with the looming threat of Iconians hanging over their heads.</em></span>
