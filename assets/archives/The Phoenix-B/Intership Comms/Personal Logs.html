    Just getting accustomed to the layout of the Phoenix, I have already stopped by the lab. Nice size and nice equipment. Still nod word from Starfleet Sciences about what I believe is a breakthrough of my research into the Orion Cave Writings.
And my good friend Soval, I&#39;m happy hes managed to settle down. I wish them nothing but the best. However if it has got me wondering, should I get married....would i want to leave ship life so soon? All my life I&#39;ve dreamed of the excitement of being here among the stars, would just seem a shame for me personally to just give it up so soon. Oh well, got to get my new uniform out and prep for my first shift in the labs. 
Log Ends.</span>

I am happy to report that shipboard life has returned to normal. Our nanite guests have been properly extracted from our computer core, and are now en route to  Corona IX for study. I wish them well. 

On the matter of much less serious things, the crew continues to grow closer still - a reminder that from adversity can come the most beautiful of things. In time, I see us becoming what we were meant to be: a unified crew, working together to overcome what lies ahead. Some have made the decision to walk the journeys of their lives with another - some for the time being, and others for slightly longer a term. While I might not necessarily agree fully with some, I shall be forthcoming with my support, if they believe sincerely that their choice shall make them complete. 

Life sometimes moves too fast, unfortunately - but there is nothing to stop us from making the best that we can out of it.</span>

I believe that I may safely say that challenges never fail to present themselves at the most inopportune times. And, I may also safely say that today has been no different. 

My main concern is the clandestine sparring group in the cargo bay - scores of the crew lining up and waiting to be matched with another, to fight to their heart&#39;s content. Even my own commanding officer is no exception. 

While I have ordered that the crewman who set up this ring be sent to the brig and kept under watch, I cannot help but wonder if perhaps, that what he said about the crew, and its support structure, or lack thereof, possesses an element of truth. 

Ought we be so quick to judge others without first looking within and asking ourselves if enough is being done? That much I believe is food for thought. This crew has been through trying times - much more than the average officer does on a daily basis, I&#39;d wager. Evolved and enlightened as we are- or should be - we cannot eliminate entirely the need and urge to release what we have pent up inside. Has my handling of this predicament been truly fair? I do not currently know. 

Will the crew come to see me in a different light for disrupting their much-needed outlet for their anger and frustration? I do not know - I shall take what comes. Was I justified in my orders? Perhaps. Perhaps not. At times, not everything can be sorted into right or wrong, after all. 

But will I condone what has been done? No, I shall not. I believe that there are healthier - and ostensibly less harmful - outlets available to the crew. An equitable solution, and consequences, should we choose to pursue those, shall be found and implemented - of that I will make sure. 

I regret that affairs on board have come to such a state. But perhaps I ought also to regret that we allowed them to regress thusly.</span>

To have to stare a demon in the eye is a feat in itself. But to stare the demons of our past, of <em>ourselves</em> - ah, <em>there</em> is an experience to shake even the sturdiest of men and women to their very core. And I think that the past few days have been solid proof of that. 

I have not been exempt, sadly. I too was forced to confront that which I hated to hear the most. In many, many ways, I am shaken to my very core, as are the rest of the crew who suffered the same cruel experience as I. For the first time in over twelve years now, I remember what it means to truly feel the cold, harsh grip of fear, squeezing at one&#39;s heart and countenance, threatening to tear it to shreds. 

And yet in some perverse ways, I feel somewhat ingratiated to the residents of the Expanse for laying bare that which I keep inside my being, deeply hidden, for fear of having to face them when the time comes, and it most certainly shall come - and has come. Running from one&#39;s demons will not work forever. Sometime, one shall have to turn around and face them, tell them that they will not twist me, make me less than the person that I am.  In this sense, I owe to them a debt, for showing me the face of what I fear the most - for teaching me the starkest lesson I could ever hope to learn.</span>

This new vessel and being appointed chief engineer has been a upward swing though that swing feels surpassed bu the emptiness I feel. My promotion was a short lived warmth that has left me longing for it to return. Much like the warmth that used tl lay beside me when I sleep.

Guess that leads me into a wound that I feel time can&#39;t erase. Shortly after being assigned to this vessel. Mackenzie and I found each other deeply swept away by one another. I even popped the question abd we were engaged to be married. But it seemed fortune was not with us, she lost her career in starfleet and shortly after had to return home to care for her mother. She left her ring on the table and a note. As torn as I am with her leaving I hope she is happy and well. I guess to me she was more than just a person. She was a place where I finally felt at home.

Before she left I took into my care five tiger Oscars, in an Aquarium I constructed within my quarters. These five little creatures have been the only things keeping me together these days. At least giving me something to care for in my free time. 

They say things always turn out in the end. Well I really hope it does for I do not know where to go from here. Alone within my hollow dark shell I am lost. Yet on the outside as hard as rock. 

I am told to try and open up yet I find it an impossible task. Because the lock is hidden from me and the has not been forged. Despite it all I take strength in my stubbornness to pull through or at least hold on. End log...</span>

Our short handed exchanges in combat or disastrous away missions certainly have begun to wear down on me. I used to have my stubbornness and determination in spades. However after our incident with the Iconians I believe I have almost exhausted my experience and knowledge for the safety for the Pheonix. Or perhaps its just I didn&#39;t have a firm plan laid out past my current rank and position or that urge to do more just seeming to be drowned out. Or that it feels I&#39;ve aged twenty years in five. Maybe this will pass maybe it won&#39;t. Perhaps I&#39;ll find a way to stop this saddle becoming too cold. Am I truly at a cross roads? I don&#39;t know. But I figure the next year will be certainly interesting. What ever comes my way. End Log.</span>

I had herd that there was an incident In sickbay it turns out the mirror version of admiral ephrix was controlling her casing these attacks. So after we found out where she is we sent an away team down there ended up fighting some Androids, I am not entirely sure where they where from but they hit pretty hard. After we got in the compound we herd a lot of loud noises intended to slow us down, along with a paralytic field in an attempt to slow us down but finely we reached the admiral after most of us took some sort of injury. I got face to face with the admiral and on her request I did what needed to be done.” <em>there was a brake in his voice</em> “I-I didn’t want to but it was the only way to stop her from being used to possibly destroy the federation its self. After words a spectral form of mirror ephrix was moving around the country side lieutenant Davis chased after it. Right now davis is Mia I hope we can recover her soon, I know I have always been a little cautious about having intelligence on a Star ship. But she’s a vital part of our crew, then after I returned to the ship I went to see commander dunamis. As it turns out mirror ephrix was controlling him which caused the death of a crewman I don’t know there name but a Vulcan crewmen seemed to be close to them. The lad started raging I tried to stop him or to at least calm him down a bit and got hit a few times. Needless to say my face looked like ground chuck. Any way once we got dunamis subdued we where beamed to medical, once there Lieutenant lylla did some sorta telepathic thing to save Commander dunamis and I guess it worked because he woke up not knowing how he got to sickbay. I’m glad he’s ok, one tends to think have we been through enough yet or is there</span>

<strong>Ensign 7-8KB</strong>
&quot;I have found myself to be placed aboard the USS Phoenix, what a lovely name for such a vessel. Coming aboard, I noticed some similarities between this vessel, and the late USS Kirkconnel. Depending on the year, the two vessels that I have mentioned, could have been designed at in the same spread of time. However, upon discovering my quarters, I learned that the captain of the USS Phoenix has been imprisoned by false accusations. With that information I set out to discover more about this predicament, and met people a long the way that could help out. They weren&#39;t kind at first, very stern and stubborn, as well as some being perverted. Upon discussing the plan with these people, I had seemed to irritate them with my persistence.  I do not blame them, they were already stressed about this matter before I. But to save the captain, and to impress them with my capabilities, I must be there. Walsh Out.&quot;</span>

I’d hate to jinx things with this entry, but I believe I’ve finally settled in here. In a physical sense, mind; my quarters show more semblance of life, I think the flowers definitely help. I shall have to thank the ensign who demonstrated their materialisation on the replicators. 

As for the crew, I’ve a long way to go. Shore leave hasn’t yet come to an end, and so encounters with my staff-to-be have been limited, and equally uncertain. I do hope I haven’t given any of them the wrong impression; I’ve got to keep reminding myself that it’s an adjustment that will require time to process, for me and for them. Perhaps when the ship starts to get a little busier, and sickbay a little less desolate, things will begin to pick up in terms of hospitality.

From what I’ve heard, they’re a wonderful crew, and I just hope I can do them justice as their department head.

Doctor Carlisle, signing off.</span>

<strong>Ensign Jayne Walsh</strong> 

<div class="quote">Upon discovering the wrong doings of Admiral Nazar, I was assigned the role of gathering the security personnel for a meeting to discuss the next move. I had a program made for me, so that we can see what the holograms of the Luna Penal Colony could actually do. Which was a lot. The security officers along with a senior officer -Lieutenant Kirhal- underwent some training procedures to help better their skills. They showed the lack of precision, which was quickly mastered at the end of my training session. I have never done such a thing before, but it was I who took initiative before anyone else did. Because of this training the capture of Captain Khassid was successful. My men did their jobs they did what I told them to do and I am proud of them. They deserve any promotion given to them. We risked our lives for this mission... But, we can&#39;t save everyone.
</div>
<div class="quote">Upon the capture of Captain Khassid, two brave men were &quot;lost&quot; on the way back to the entrance. Ensign John Ferentz was very serious about not going in to save them, even though my men were capable of doing so. Finally when Captain Khassid was beamed aboard the wrecked USS Phoenix, we made our efforts to save the two MACOs that were lost. I was leading the front lines and Ensign Jesse beside me and Ferentz leading up the rear. We were close but not close enough, because in desperation of returning to the Phoenix Ferentz made the call to beam everyone up, besides from the MACOs. Many security officers of my squadron were devastated as well as I. But I guess that&#39;s a price to pay, and we don&#39;t know if John made the right call in the end. But I guess the MACOs wanted to go out with a bang and so they did. The colony blew up, with them inside it, and that was that. They were Heroes, we were Heroes and we went back to our duties. It was an honor to be apart of this mission and I hope the Captain recovers soon. Walsh out.</div></span>

On a side note, though i am going to start tinkering with some weapons the &quot;Right&quot; way, i am going be kept under close holographic supervision by none other than Ensign Jayne. Yes, we had a rough start she and I, but that doesn&#39;t mean i cant be friends with a woman whos actually a hologram right? heh..Any who. Second: I dressed up and attended the award ceremony down in France. I was very proud of my shipmates! They saved the federation! they saved our captain! and they certainly earned their stripes. There is a saying within my family: &quot;You don&#39;t earn your stripes by simply pressing some buttons or getting hit on the head by space rocks. We earn it by doing something UNEXPECTED!&quot; Those words I took it by heart...and i think so did they...&quot;unexpectedly&quot; as i would put it. Ahh....romance and the wildness were in the air that night..and boy what a night it was....I received a transmission from my brother saying i got my grandfathers and even my fathers stuff sent to me! I looked through them when i got back only to find my grandpas journal amongst them...all those amazing things he did...&quot;</span>

<div class="quote">Entry One. I have just arrived on the Phoenix. The Captain is, as expected, a man of few words. Welcoming as he was, I felt a sense of apprehension- expected as it might be for meeting someone new. I look forward to meeting the rest of the engineering team. I will send them a personal message shortly to introduce myself. As an aside, I believe I have a returning sensation of that previous anxiety; I have hopes that this situation will not replicate the Monroe. This, of course, means that I should make my capabilities for my station apparent and without question, but I must do so without alienating those who might have applied to the position before me. If there are those onboard who desired the position of CEO, I must endeavor especially to assure my position with them. It will be an essential part of earning their trust, and trust is the first step to proper unit cohesion.

<div class="quote">I am now comfortable in saying that life is less stressful on the Phoenix. The unease of some people have died down to a minimum and everyone is resuming their duties like the Civil War never happened, which is good. As for me, I have treated every day like it was just a regular day, nothing seems to budge at the moment. However, I have seemed to attach myself to one of the crew members names Jane Autumn. I do not know how long this will last, since I have never dealt with such a thing before. But we will see how it pans out in due time. Being a security officer is very.... different to say the least, I find the everyday patrolling to be quite easy, since everybody seems to be professional as of now, and the security features on this ship are always up and running. It is quite easy for once, but it feels odd that, that, is the case. Usually there would be many situations that I would have to attend to as a security officer, but there is oddly, none. I have found that my entertainment has been mostly in the devices called &quot;Holodecks&quot;. Recently I demonstrated complicated security training protocols which involved me becoming out manned in a five versus one. I managed to complete this task in under 2 minutes and this was all done during the tour. When all was said and done, I managed to get a good remark off of Lieutenant Motlan who said &quot;That I could replace him one day.&quot;. To me, that was an honor to hear those words from a respected ACOS. Furthermore, I would like to report that my experience on this ship has been the best experience of my 9 year career. The people, the support, the experience can only be described as outstanding. I hope that my actions can really help and support this vessel and that I can move up in the ranks. But as of now, I am just happy that I am an Ensign aboard the USS Phoenix.</div></span>

<div class="quote">As of now, I have still yet to meet with the Chief of Security. Odds are, that he or she has been left behind. It is quite odd to think that the assistant has made his presence more known that the boss of that assistant. But they do say that those people do more heavy work than the superior power. If I were to become Chief of Security one day, my first thing that I would change would be the activeness of my Job, as security is one of the top priorities of this vessel. Maybe soon, this, &quot;Chief of Security&quot; will make an appearance. As of now, it is undecided that there even is such a person of that rank on board the Phoenix.

My first day was rough. Nothing had been organised in Sickbay. The Lying-Fleabag was inefficient, time-wasting and dull. The Wall-Creeper had no idea what he was doing, and would exaggerate tall stories. The Space-Ape could talk the hind legs off a donkey. And I don’t feel at ease in my crew quarters, there is one bedroom for a Tellarite and another bedroom for a ghost. Time to sleep, and see what the starship does tomorrow.</span>

First thing’s first. Sharing bunk with the younglings isn’t the toughest part of being on the ship. But trying to catch up with their lingo is like being a labyrinth. 

Some of them with the innuendoes? Bloody hell. Given the fact that I’m probably as old as a fossil fuel on this ship, talk about the number of stares I’ve been getting while I walk around with a Shakespeare book in my hand. But love these buggers, being around the ensigns brighten up my day. Everyday is a new day, to learn new things, yes?

<em>Oh</em>, the date with Blanche went exceptionally well. Sometimes I feel like she’s judging me internally for enjoying the time learning how to knit with her. And sometimes I’m judging her for the number of times I’ve been reminded for my usual medical check-ups.

... And here goes another day for a routine with the ensigns; which I am hundred percent sure that they are growing rather bored of my ‘grandfather stories’ while I try to share my experience. I’m surprised that some of them are taking notes. Truly hope that I’m not just another long-winded security lad on board.

Love working with them.

Kasper, signing off.</span>

Well, we made it. Off the island, that is. It was quite the adventure, I must admit. When we arrived, everything and everyone was in disarray. No one knew much. Thankfully, I had taken a lot of time away from home to play in the woods outside my home. I had a lot of time to think about things while I was on that island. It made me realize one thing, among many. This part is addressed to my father. I hate you. I hate what you did and how you did it. I get you were Chief Science, but your ship could&#39;ve spared you for <em>one week</em>, Father. The ship still would&#39;ve run. I had to bury my Mother, while you were out...doing whatever. She gave me something, you know. In her will, she left me something for when I joined Starfleet. She left me a physical book and a letter. I&#39;ve yet to open the letter, but I&#39;ve read that book more times than I can count. It&#39;s called &#39;War and Peace&#39;. It&#39;s quite good. Anyway. I&#39;m getting off track. Father...I hope I never see you again. I know you&#39;ll never hear this...but I hate you. You ran our home like a dictatorship and when you were gone...my mother was the only sane one. 

We&#39;re all alive...but I hope I never see you again.

Schneider, signing off.</span>

At last the mystery of commodore Khassid&#39;s affliction is nearly at its end. What remains is to find the one who caused it, and we shall see how things develop. 

In conversation with the Commodore and doctor Carlisle, however, I detected something under their voices as they talked - anger. Pain. Grief. Anguish. It does not take the ability of empathy to understand that the culprit has, indirectly, inflicted such hurt upon them with his actions. 

This worries me. The anger in the Commodore&#39;s voice was evident - I pray that, having found our culprit, whenever that may be, that they will stay true to who we are despite their feelings. Transgress not against those who would do the same to us. I have felt first hand what it is like to want to wrong those who seek to harm us. I have heard the temptation whisper in my ear. I know what anyone is capable of given the correct motivation - myself in particular. Yes, mister Zoyill has caused us a great deal of pain, suffering and anguish with his actions, I acknowledge that; but I pray that we shall not bring ourselves to his level by doing the same in retaliation.</span>

<div class="quote">My time on the USS Phoenix has been long lived. I have encountered many things during my 9 year Journey of being a hologram, but nothing compares to the scenes that I have seen on this vessel. 
</div>
<div class="quote">This experience has had its ups and downs already, but the downs only give me opportunities to improve myself as a person on board this vessel. I have been commended for my work by chiefs and commanders but, it should not be something I should hold onto forever, the Job is whats most important. Mistakes happen, and I learned that just because I am a hologram, doesnt mean that I cant make mistakes, it is something that I was struggling with until now. These mistakes are not something to be frowned upon, rather, it should be something to learn from. I&#39;ve learned to discover manners, politeness and respect for the fellow officers on this ship, and I sincerely appologize to those that I have given a hard time. It was not my intention to do so.
</div>
<div class="quote">I have been placed on 1 week patrol duty and have been suspended from bridge duty for that period of time. In the beggining, I thought that this would mean that I have done something wrong, but I now realise that it was not the Commanders intention to destroy my confidence, rather, to learn from it and utilise the experience. For that, I respect his wishes fully.
</div>
<div class="quote">Finally. I have been placed on an away team mission, surveying the small planet called Thressha Minor. Nothing eventful so far, but all that might change in the next few hours or so that we have left on this mission. Since I am not a science officer, I cant really specify the exact readings of the planet. But what I can say, as a security officer, is that my duty is to protect the away team. There is no threat to them at the moment of making this log, but I will keep things up to date once aboard the Phoenix, Walsh out.</div></span>

After providing backup on the surface in the apparent rescue of a member of the medical team, I returned to the Phoenix for a short break before intending on going back to my patrol at the mines. I was swiftly interrupted, however, by a security call to deck 18. Upon arriving, me, Walsh, and Jesse were informed they lost contact with the Main Operations Room. We prepared to breach, with a small bit of bickering of who was taking point, which was purely down to stress, and we settled upon me leading, and then my code failed.

We got a science officer to unlock the door, and were immediately fired upon from within. We of course opened fire again. The doors opened further and we could finally see our targets, and began attempting to neutralise them on stun. Walsh was shot, but due to her being a hologram, did not matter too much. As we attempted to neutralise them, one Tal Shiar agent, which there were five of, managed to beam out, taking a member of the Operations personnel with him... Or them, shouldn’t assume.

We eventually neutralised the threat, detaining one that wasn’t stunned by us. I tried too make the conscious one tell us where they took our crewman by saying if they co-operated, they’d get a lesser sentence, but to no avail. The science officer decided to try and speak to the conscious one in Romulan, and threatened to mind-meld with him, before asking us if we wanted him to, which we, the security team, denied. The science officer apparently then threatened to do it anyway in Romulan, which the Tal Shiar rightfully notified us of.</span>

I instructed for us to check their mouthes for suicide pills, to which there were none, and then they were beamed to the brig. They’re all currently charged with trespass, threatening grievous bodily harm, being affiliated with the Tal Shiar, attempted assault on Starfleet personnel, and kidnapping. A security alert was not activated during this event for some reason. Rather eventful day, anyway. End log.</span>

Have I talked about Shar here? If not, she’s my girlfriend who I would blow up the world for. I love her so much and I just...I just can’t believe how freaking lucky I am! For getting the sweetest, kindest and most beautiful woman on the ship to be mine. And, the Commodore died. This woman I wished so much was my mom, her and Sauon..and now she’s gone. This perfect lovely woman, killed by damm natural causes. She didn’t deserve to go out like that, lying dead on the hard floor of the deck 17...and I hope wherever she ended up. She’s being treated like a goddess, for bringing so much light into the world.

<div class="quote">It has been a while, clearly, but I&#39;m glad to get back into writing my logs.
</div>
<div class="quote">Mission Briefing: During the time on New Romulus, a lot has gone down and I was involved in most of it. Starting off with the first away mission dealing with the Tal Shiar . I was injured in conflict with the Romulan terrorists as they committed suicide risking their lives and the away team. I took initiative and threw it away attempting to save the lives of the many over the few, which resulted in my injuries and subsequently the terrorists deaths. Away mission number two: was saving Counsellor Houston from the Fleet Admiral named Valdain. In some ways it was successful, but our attempts at apprehending the criminal were unsuccessful. I have not met up with the counsellor since then, but rumor has it that he is in bad shape. Away mission number three: was to discover the whereabouts of the Fleet Admiral, luckily he was a teacher, who taught some kids at a school nearby. Where we found a girl named T’Diri, she was nervous, however we got the information we needed to conduct further investigations thanks to the support of Commander Bellator. Away mission number four: I was delighted to accompany the captain on a dual away mission to scout out some further information on the Tal Shiar ship called the Arrinthe, information was found, yet we were interrupted by the Fleet Admiral himself but he was taken down in an instant by an unknown being. He was sent to the brig for a short time then afterwards beamed himself out of his cell. Away mission number five: After dealing with the capture of Officer Patkotol, we set out in search of him shortly after. After Encountering the Tal Shiar Borg drones, Lieutenant Tarna’Motlan took them down with ease, but passed out shortly after. I rescued the officer and we beamed out of the dark and dreary place that was an old Tal Shiar experiment.</div></span>

We were beamed aboard the Tal shiar ship in order to retrieve an artifact that was found by the archaeological away team that could only be described as the bringer of life and death. Once retrieved we beamed it aboard, yet, we couldn&#39;t beam there ourselves as the Arrinthe quickly speeded to warp, we decided to take the manual route as we went to the bridge. The ship could destroy us in one hit, yet the crew of the Arrithne were concentrated on fighting rather than working together, which lead them to their downfall. The fleet admiral was captured along with most of his crew and I maneuvered the Arrinthe out of the way of it&#39;s current trajectory. He is now in custody on the USS Phoenix and is to be brought back to the Senate to await his Trial</div></span>

I for one, as a security officer have experienced every single side of a person when it has come to this realization. You have the calm, the rational, the diplomats, And on the other hand you have the chaotic, the irrational, the know it alls. Where do I fit into the description, well, I do not know. On one hand I have been calm and rational. Diplomatic at times yes, but not as much, but on the other hand Some people might think the opposite of me and I would not even know it until it was mentioned. On another note, during my time on this ship I would have never expected to have fallen in love, yet, I did. She&#39;s lovely, the most prettiest girl on the ship and I love her to bits, I wont mention names but she knows who she is if she sees this at all. But back to security. Recently at around 2100 hours, I arrested a vulcan Ensign on the counts of Intentionally Racist Assault and Battery. Crazy as it seems, it happened, almost choked a Romulan, because he was Romulan. He is currently in the brig along with the fleet admiral. During this time on the brig, an epidemic broke out on the ship, where it started to grow full with life. Apparently all decks are having the problem, trees, grass, animals popping out of nowhere on the decks. Lets just hope that this all gets sorted out soon. I love this ship and it&#39;s crew, they are all beautiful beings in their own special way, and I hope they live long and prosper, as the vulcans say. Walsh out.</div></span>

Personal Log, Ensign Syth.

I am still stuck in the Brig, as such I am writing this on a piece of paper with a blue crayon, no doubtly given to him as a insult. I have tried to be useful in my state of Pon Farr, yet reflecting, I should have just isolated myself. I have requested a Ensign to get me medical attention, however I somehow doubt he will carry forward my request. The beginnings of my own personal crew database has been confiscated, along with the limited research I did in a spatial anomaly. As I write this, I run out of paper to use, meaning I must now find another use for my time. Unfortunately, even with this material, time has been passing extremely slowly. If only I could get medical attention, I could return to the person that graduated the academy. I am hoping once it it over, I could return to my work. In the mean time, I have to find a place to hide this, as proven by my PADD, confidentiality isn’t a given on this ship. End log.</span>

I just started aboard the Phoenix. The crew has been very welcoming and of course I was really excited to get started working with a warp core. I meet a really nice Lieutenant who showed me around enginereing she is one of my commanding officers. She seemed really cool. I can&#39;t wait to hangout with the rest of the crew. End Log.</span>

I have been on the Phoenix for a couple of days now. I have meet some really interesting people the department head is really nice and so are all the engineers. I am excited to be working with such wonderful people. One day hopefully I will make Lieutenant but there is still time. One day hopefully I will become Chief Engineer but not for a while I want to stay on this ship with this crew for as long as I can and I want to stay under Commander Nox for as long as I can I feel like he has a lot to teach me about being an Engineer a board a ship something I missed when I was part of R and D in Starfleet. I also met my roommate he is interesting to say the least he has done any shifts yet or even met his commanding officer so I&#39;m a little concerned about that. I also met the most amazing woman a couple of nights ago she is very kind and personable. She might be one of the most beatiful women I have ever meet. I should her my program the one that I have been making since I was a 15 year old with my dad. I haven&#39;t shown anyone that except my dad. I made a few changes to it to add her interests like her favorite star ship and took out some people that I had programed to make the simulation more real. I think I want to take her to the Observation deck after we eat at the mess hall I think the stars when your going at warp can be very beautiful. End log.</span>

I’ve been on board for 3 days now, my first day I met a man, I honestly didn’t expect things to be moving so rapidly. But I like him, he’s sweet and I can tell he’s really trying. I’m supposed to go on a date with him tonight...but I’m not sure if I should bring him a gift, we just met so I’m not sure what he would like. From what I can tell, he’s quite fond of the enterprise D. But that’s not his favorite class of starship. On other notes, I met the chief medical officer, my boss, she’s got a bit of an accent which I like, she’s really sweet, the second day I got aboard she gave me my physical examination it was easy, to say the least. Except for that sex question..that made me uncomfortable. I know it’s just medical stuff but still. Right after my shift I went back to my quarters to get dressed for my first date with Malcolm. Just when I was about to request permission to enter his quarters, the door opens and Malcolm and his idiot roommate are standing there like dear in headlights! Malcolm&#39;s roommate(who’s name shall remain anonymous) had broken his nose. All the two would tell me was that he slipped. Honestly I was furious with Malcolm, and his roommate. After we got his roommate treated. Malcolm and I had a nice quiet night on the holodeck. Malcolm had designed the most amazing simulation. I can’t wait to see what he has in store for tonight.

This is Olsen, signing off.</span>

<div class="quote">I had another wonderful date with Amy today. She is truely amazing, she gave me this great gift its an Akira class model starship that is my favorite class. I am going to put it on my table next to my bed where I write my reports so I can look at it when I&#39;m am doing paper work to brightten my day when I need it. We also go to see the observation deck it was a great veiw. Amy even is going to meet Tribby LaForge next time we go to the holodeck.  We are going to try our hand at sailing. Amy wants to take things slower which I&#39;m fine with they were going a little. I&#39;m in it for the long hall I want this relationship to last for a long time. The best part though I think we might have had our first kiss it was only a small peek but I think it counts. But then Konrad messed up the workspace which I am no calling his half of the room honestly everyting but my bedroom is just his I don&#39;t care anymore I all need is my bathfoom and bed and I&#39;m fine. Of the room but I don&#39;t care he has his half and I have mine.</div></span>

“I had another night with Malcom, and the more I get to know him, the more I wish we weren’t apart. Our date last night in the observation lounge was truly something else, when I brought him the model of his favorite ship I could tell he was truly happy. But his gifts to me were something else. He gave me a necklace which I’ve promised to wear as much as much as possible. I’m not sure if I can truly admit wether or not I love him. But he’s really trying to adapt to me and I like that. I told him I wanted to take things slow and he said he was okay with that. He’s so adaptable..annoyingly so oh well. I’m rambling I should probably reorganize the equipment in sickbay. I don’t want Carlisle to kill me my 3rd day on the job.”</span>

<div class="quote">Well I think me and Amy are going through a bit of a rough patch. The first few dates were amazing we really connected. I don&#39;t understand, the first time she was late it just seemed like a fluke. Then she cancels our date and sends me away after I worked hard on that meal. I am just not sure what is going on. I thought me and her had a real connection I know it has only been 4 days but she was different she seemed to just get me. I think it is nothing that I am probably over thinking this whole thing. She is the only girl I have had a 18 hour date with and I enjoyed every minute of it. I think I have an idea though....Wish me Luck Malcolm out.

<div class="quote">It felt good to get some exercise and clear my head yesterday. I&#39;m excited for work today. My mom taught me that fitness is one main requirements of a Starfleet officer. I should really call my parents and see how they have been and my brother to he is going to graduate from the academy this year. He has 3 majors he always was a smart kid. I only got the one but I love what I do. Engineering you get a problem and you get to solve it using your hands and your head.  I love working in engineering getting to work with an operational warp core is so much fun compared to the ones we had on our labs doing research. It&#39;s like the beating heart of the ship. Speaking of hearts, me and Amy may be going through a rough patch but, this rough patch has made me realize how much I miss her and how strong my feelings are for her...It hope it ends soon. It has helped me to focus on the reasons why I care about her so much. The qualities I appreciate most about her the way she helps comfort her patients with that shy yet thoughtful smile. The way she is stern when she needs to be, she could stare down a full Klingon platoon, with just that look of disappointment. The face she gets when amazed by something.  The look of excitement she gets when we talk. The look of curiosity when she asks her thoughtful questions. I love her ambition and her emotional strength, that give her that drive to succeed despite all odds....I have to go my shift starts soon. That&#39;s all for now Malcolm signing off.

Amy Olsen 
Star date 154346.82

Last night me and Malcom went through a bit of a rough patch. A patient that I have has been putting a strain on our relationship. I missed my sailing date with Malcom and I have a patient in need of emotional care, let’s be honest this is way 
above my pay
grade(Metaphorically speaking) I’m going to forward him to a counselor once I get the CMO’s approval, but I did find out what’s been giving him those headaches, I’m not going to say on log, because you know. Doctor, patient, confidentiality. When I woke up this morning I was late for my shift, luckily no one was around. But I better not make a habit of that. Oh well, that’s all I’ve got to say. Until next time, this is Amy Olsen signing off.

<div class="quote">I just got back from probably one of the best dates Amy and me have had. I feel in the water but it was all part of the fun. We kissed several times and the were good. For a shy girl she is a really good kisser. I really liked that she made it a storm if it were any other woman they might have made a calm sea but she is full of adventure I love that about her. I like sailing with her she will make a great captain one day. I need to start figuring out how I can make a boat for when we go on our trip to Earth.  I might have to ask for a few favors from my family and Warp Engineering friends but I will get Amy a Yatch to sail the open sea&#39;s together. I bet my old colleagues would be willing to help with build it I will owe them so many bottles of Kanar. It will be a surpirse for our trip to Earth and Risa, I know she will love it. I will model it off the one she made  in the holodeck. I just can&#39;t wait for our date tonight. She liked the Gumbo something to keep in mind for the future. Well got to start my shift.

<div class="pre pre--multiline nohighlight"> I had a very slow day in sickbay yesterday. But it was worth it because at the end of the day, I got to spend it with Malcom. We got to go to the holodeck and went sailing. He made the most delicious gumbo. Which is about 79 million times better that the replicator can ever make. Since we’ve met we’ve been on dates nonstop. I believe it’s Malcolm’s way of getting to know me better, which I like. He’s supposed to come to my quarters so we can share the evening meal together. Honestly I’m glad we’re staying in. I’m tired of walking corridors. He’s supposed to meet Joel tonight. I just home my two boys can get along. I’d have to choose between the two of them. I know this is quite random but I never knew how much I liked sailing. Me and Malcom got to sail a storm it was so peaceful even though we were in a life threading situation. But it’s all part of the fun. Welp until next time. This is Amy Olsen signing off. </div>

<div class="pre pre--multiline nohighlight">Just a short one today log book, nothing’s changed things are nominal in sickbay. And everyone seems to like me? That’s so weird for me since I don’t really entirely love people. But to shorten it I’m starting to become fond of the crew. I’ve been aboard nearly a week now. And I’ve gotten to run my first physical examination. I’m sure the CMO would be quite proud, but that’s just one of many steps toward a promotion..I think I’ll just keep life simple for now. Anyways that’s all I’ve got for today, until next time this is Amy Olsen. Signing off. </div>

<div class="quote">I wrote a report on the warp diagnostic test I did, and I think Lt.Cmdr. Nox liked it. Hopefully this puts me a little closer to becoming a Lieutenant. I hope one day when I&#39;m a chief engineer that I can be as good as he. In other news I took Konrad out for a few drinks and that backfired but, I think all of our roommate hangouts from now on will not involve any form of drinking at all. In other news I asked my parents and they and my warp core friends agreed to make a boat for if me and Amy when we get to Earth, I owe them like a million bottles of Kanar and Romulan Ale. Though it might not end up being as big as the one on the holodeck, I think Amy will like it cause it will be our boat and real. My dad will send me some designs in a few weeks. I trust him with this he makes starships at Utopia Planitia so hard can a boat be compaired to a starship. In other news I am going to call my brother tomorrow and see how is studies at the Academy are going maybe one day he will serve on a starship like me. I hope I can be a good role model for him. I always try my best but, I am not the prefect officer. I can&#39;t wait for him to graduate. I hope I can make it to his graduation, though I&#39;m sure he would understand if I can&#39;t. I&#39;m really proud of him though he is the top studnet in Omega Squad. I&#39;m sure he will make a fine science officer one day. Well I best be going Malcolm out.

<div class="quote">I went on another great date with Amy. I got to see her quaters she keeps them clean which I like about her. I also got to meet her parrot Joel, he was really nice and social bird. I also am slowly figuring out how to take things slower with Amy. I made Salmon for dinner though I did forget to bring my cello so she didn&#39;t get to hear me play but she will one day. I also helped fix her replicator, it was increadibly difficult more so than I thought it was going to be. Well the sail boat it coming along for when we get to earth my dad already sent the plans Amy is going to love it. It is 30 ft boat so smaller than the one is the holodeck but it will still have many of the same things she liked about the boat I told him the baots name is Enterprise. I am also going to send a holo recording to my brother here soon. I also found some small things with a warp core nothing major that I had fixed by when techically not the end of my shift but, I got them done. I just hope that Lt.Cmdr. Nox likes this next report I tried to explain every small detail about what I found. I made sure I was very dilligent. That&#39;s all for now Malcolm out.

<span class="pre pre--inline">I believe I have made a friend! Tarna certainly says he is my friend and I suppose his is the only word I can take, so yes. I have a friend now.
I’m not truly sure what happens next, but hell yeah! I’m really starting to get accustomed to The Phoenix. And I have to say I love it here...I’ve enjoyed myself these past few days and I frankly...actually desperately hope it stays that way.
Although Tarna’s admittance that this is an unlucky ship doesn’t make for high hopes.
Either way, I’m glad he is my friend for now. We hugged three times! I cannot fucking remember the last time I got a hug from anyone who isn’t Mama and Mum...that’s just fucking sad....
But still, good things seem to be on their way, and I eagerly await our next lesson.</span>

<div class="quote">We just got another report of Breen attacks, it said 30 ships had been attacked so far and most were destroyed. Why though that is the question. Well whatever the reason I am prepared work my butt of keeping this ship together. Though I will be sure to make a letter to my family just in case...I...Well in either case I hope to make my parents proud. I will probably go to the holodeck to test my phaser training. If they do beam over they almost certainly would try to take main engineering. In lighter news I got to do another warp diagnostic test. It was fun, I Iike working with an operation warp core and not the ones at Starfleet R and D. I really like serving on board this ship. Here I am exploring the stars in the vast unknown. It feels like what I was born to do work with warp theory while traveling that vast reaches of space. That&#39;s all for now Malcolm signing off.

People will get hurt and the CMO and Surgeons will be needed in sickbay. I don’t mind helping people around the ship or on planets. It’s just that I’d rather not have to declare anyone dead.

Looking back now at the events of the past few days, I find myself deeply troubled. Not merely at the events of the universe around us, but also the events and feelings that occur within the bounds of Phoenix&#39;s walls. Trouble to give one pause... and space for reflection and improvement. 

To begin with, I worry much about the ever looming Breen threat. The crew and I have seen the unspeakable, wanton destruction the Confederacy has inflicted upon us; eight vessels, <em>medical</em> vessels, all heavily damaged and only just barely spaceworthy - and more than that still. I wonder to myself exactly what the Confederacy&#39;s motivations are - why target the heart of the now mostly-unified Khitomer Alliance? Why risk bringing the wrath of its other member powers down on its head? At once puzzling and deeply worrying - and the doubt that there is a darker puppetmaster continues to shrink in my mind with every passing moment. 

More worrying still is the replacement of chancellor Vrolt of the Klingon Empire - by dishonorable methods, it seems. I have heard some things about his replacement - and what I <em>have</em> heard is by no means pleasing to the ears. I shudder to think what this could mean for the future - we cannot afford another Federation-Klingon war, not with the Breen breathing down our proverbial necks. It also fills me with dread to imagine what the two powers could do allied - and that reality is most certainly shaping up to be the reality at hand. 

Oh, I prattle on; this information will be furnished to other ships in time no doubt. What reason have I to act like a broken record and repeat what has already been said? It becomes clear to me as time passes that it has become an unfortunate habit of mine - a habit I shall seek earnestly to correct and improve upon.</span>

But enough on external matters - recent internal matters has given me pause as well. Ever since my first officer came aboard I have found, disturbingly, that, despite my dislike of secrecy and want of transparency with my staff, I neglect to provide it in turn. I have become too used to the management of Phoenix with just myself and the department heads, I believe, that I have forgotten that my proverbial right hand is also here to help me with my task - and I would do well to ensure that he is able to do so to the best of my limited ability. I shall, and will adapt and bear that well in mind - I do not have to bear this task alone. 

But why merely sit and lament to the stars and the empty air of my quarters of my failings as a captain? I cannot be the <em>perfect</em> captain - and in good honesty I believe I will never quite be. No one will. Nonetheless that does not mean that I cannot set it as my mark, and by it hone my aim and shoot straighter than ever before. I shall waddle on, as the humans say. Remind me to find out how that particular phrase came to be. Keep moving, keep forging - keep my flame bright and hot, as it is. Better days shall come; and I shall not earn them by remaining in my doubts.</span>

<div class="quote">I went on an away mission today. The Ship was attack by the Breen there were floating bodies every where. Amy was also there I&#39;m glad she is safe, I was scared that they might try and set traps on the ship. I would never forgive myself if anything happened to her. I can&#39;t wait for our date in the arboretum on Saturday. The breifing with the commander went well, he is a good commanding officer to have. He made sure to listen to our input. What made the Breen such a formidable adversary in the dominion wars is their energy dissipator weapons if they have retruned to using them. Which seems to be shown in the first recording, Lieutenant Walsh and I discovered. We could be in trouble without the help of Klingons. The reason I know this is cause, I&#39;m I have sent my entire adult life working on warp cores, energy dissipator are literally my worst nightmare. They drain power from all the systems, the best defense is with a small adjustment to a Tritium intermix which is a component found only in warp cores on Klingon vessels. For us we would still need weeks to actually have a good defense against those weapons. Well best be getting back to main engineering there is a lot to do before a Breen attack.

Entry# 001, Subject: Follow-up

So far for the past few weeks I&#39;ve been beginning to enjoy my time here on the Phoenix, I&#39;ve taken part in a western venture to rescue our crewmembers which I&#39;ve kinda ended up having my hands burnt by hot iron bars, participated in a holodeck simulation~ Well, I&#39;ll talk about that another time. 
Anyways, I even gotten myself a kiss from Ensign Caytln, one of the engineering members onboard. 
As of right now I&#39;m looking forward in taking her out on a holodeck date, and possibly dance with her until we- Umm, well I rather not go into detail. 
So far I had not been out with the crowd trying to help anyone, and I hope to at least try to live up my great grandfather&#39;s reputation. We will see what happens.

Disturbing, this conflict with the Breen is getting more and more confusing by the day. The chemicals we found on the Breen solider with the open chest cavity doesn’t make it any better. I just hope we can come to a peaceful solution soon. Before things really get out of hand. They’ve attacked and boarded the most peculiar vessels, you’d think they’d go after our most technologically advanced warships, but every time they seem to be going after research, and medical vessels.

<div class="quote">It has been a while since my last log but things have been happening around here. Whether it has to do with the Commodore departing us, or the fact that security has had a new change in leadership, I can’t tell. I had gotten used to the fact that we might never have a Chief of Security on this station again and persuaded myself to become the authority for security as a whole. But yet, when you believe that you have accomplished your goals, there will always be something to wash you out, like sand on a beach. Each and every day on the ship felt like the previous one, walking, talking or whatever a security officer would do on a “Normal day”.  I understand now, what it truly means to become tired, it&#39;s not just the fact that you need rest, you must also take into account the work you are doing and whether or not you get bored of it. Frankly, I can say that I am tired of my current work. The Chief of Security is nowhere to be seen, just like the last one. Tarna, promised me to be working more often then not, but the only message I received from him was this morning. It wasn&#39;t even from him at all.

In reality, I can&#39;t let a simple reaction persuade me into thinking that the decision I made was a wrong one. This reality has made me realize that I am not cut out for relationships, there is too much trust involved in it, which I still find hard to comprehend.

<div class="quote">Stardate 97967.87 the ship was attacked. We were receiving spikes in the sensors for a while and discovered that those spikes were warp signatures of a Breen heavy Raider tracking our trajectory. We dropped out of warp and we were met with nothing but silence, for what I could say was about a couple minutes. Then, the Raider  attacked, it was targeting our Nacelles and our secondary hull, a place known to be most vulnerable when it comes to attacks like these. The battle lasted only minutes until The captain decided to get us out of there at warp speed, too bad the Raider caught up to us only minutes after the captains departure from the bridge. It is now that I formally tell you that I, Lieutenant Jayne Walsh (Junior Grade) Took command of the USS Phoenix for approximately 45 minutes and 37 seconds. This action was purely off of my own instinct and that was to protect the ship and it&#39;s crew.

We went forward with the decision which proved to be effective. However we had to drop out of warp as the Raider hit us as well, I could not risk the Phoenix to become damaged at warp speed. Sadly, we were met with what I would call, the ship graveyard. 8 medical ships, torn to pieces. I informed the bridge to arm themselves and to get weapons online, in case that we had to fight our way out, the entirety of the bridge crew, including myself agreed to not destroy the Raider if encountered. But, to only disable it so we could escape to federation territory. And that is where this log ends. If punishment is needed for my actions on this vessel, then so be it. I take 100% responsibility for them.

Making sure they are all right we are all a team in Engineering well hopefully they will get better soon. I had a wonderful walk with Amy in the Arboretum, we talked and got see all the beautiful plants. We have a holodeck date tonight I&#39;m really excited, although I&#39;m not certain what program we will do, well we will figure it out when we get there. I...Think....I might...Be in love with her.

I volunteered to do  double shifts to cover for the Engineers that got injured in the attack. I also had an amazing date with Amy, we got to sail the Mediterranean sea. It was very peaceful and we fell asleep in each others arms it was amazing. For one night all that craziness with the Breen didn&#39;t matter, cause I had a date with Amy.

Entry# 002, Subject: <em>Unknown</em>

It never ends doesnt it? The struggles of maintaining the peace between the Federation and the Klingon Empire. The Chancellors life didn&#39;t have to end this way, there are so many questions left unanswered: What, How, and Why? But, the Klingons have their own reasons and we have to abide by their traditions and how they deal with dishonorable warriors.
Matters aside, I look forward to returning to earth, and I hope to give the Japanese elder cherry blossom park a visit once again. Maybe i might ask Caitlyn to come visit with me, but we already did that on the holodeck. Heh. As for me, I walked out of the battle bridge when I know all too well that they had needed me, and now that&#39;s going to go on my record. I gotta make it up for that somehow given time.

He deserves it, he repaired the bridge module single handedly alone.. I really love him. He’s a good man. Not just that we gained a 2nd and 3rd officer at the ceremony. Both of which deserved their promotions. I can’t wait to begin my first day as Lieutenant. </div>

Amy and Me both made Lieutenant Junior Grade, then we had an amazing date together we ate at Sisko&#39;s Creole Kitchen and took a walk around the pier. I love her so much, she is most amazing woman I have ever met. My friend Cosek Burns made Lieutenant Commander and is now the second officer, he deserved it, he is a hard worker. Amy&#39;s friend and boss, was promoted to Commander and given the position of third officer, the way Amy talks about her she definitely deserved it. I hope to do this ship and it&#39;s crew proud.

<div class="quote">As I said stated in my last log both me and Amy were promoted Lieutenant Junior Grade, which was amazing. I&#39;m very proud of her. I am thankful for this opportunity. Me and Amy had a wonderful 4 days of leave. Me and Amy traveled to San Francisco. She was able to meet my parents, they really liked her. I think she liked them as well. I really love Amy, she is truly one of the most amazing woman I have ever met. She is very adventurous one of the many reasons I like her so much. We went camping and got to see an amazing view of the forest and mountains. Then we traveled to  New York City and saw the view from the tallest building. We flew a shuttle over San Francisco during night it was a incredible sight, I had seen it a few times before but, for this time it was even more amazing it was probably because Amy was the pilot. We also went to this pub called Ricky&#39;s pub in San Francisco, we meet the owner who remarked I sat in the same seat as James T. Kirk which was really incredible, the owner said he had no doubt I would live live up to the restaurants esteemed patrons reputations. I hope I can prove him right not for fame or glory but, because I hope I can be a good Starfleet Officer. I hope to go back there sometime.  Well I am going off to my shift.

Entry#003, Subject: A Cold Day in Space

After we brought Deep Space 22 back from it&#39;s icy sleep, I&#39;ve looked through some of the old earth fads from the computer library under the word <em>Cryonics</em>. This idea came from the 20th century when most of humanity were afraid of death and as a result they put those who had died in a space capsule, launched them into space, and hoped that in the near future when all medical is advanced enough to bring them all back. 4 centuries later only three people survived and returned to earth with new lives ahead of them. 

I never knew that the cryogenic effect would occur on such a large scale. I&#39;m just relieved that most of the people survived that ordeal, and we will make sure it never happens again..

Putting ones self in frozen sleep is an smart idea, but sometimes it can come at a terrible cost if something goes wrong. I just hope we dont go down that path

<div class="quote">We have been fighting to keep the ship from disappearing out of time in engineering. It is really difficult since there nothing we can do about that really. Except watch as parts of our ship stop existing. The hardest part about this mission is I haven&#39;t seen Amy in two days. I miss her so much, we hardly have gotten to see each other over the last four days. I didn&#39;t even know it was possible to miss someone this much. All I want to go talk to her, hug her, and kiss her, but I understand what our mission is I know what I must do in order to complete it. It doesn&#39;t really leave time for me to get to see the woman I love.  I have been on three away missions so far and helped to save three admirals. I believe the fourth was safely recovered today. I hope that we can rescue the rest quickly and restore the Federation. End of log...</div></span>

<div class="quote">Today has been- well interesting. This is my first log on Phoenix- and enough has happened today to not fit inside this single log. I was so worried that I was never going to be welcome here- but I have been completely proven wrong. Everyone here is so kind. Aaron Miller, Newton Eirson... They have welcomed me here with such compassion that I feel already like their my family. I never felt like this on the Ganymede...
But something is wrong. There is a party going on- but I have no idea why. Like, I am happy that they are enjoying themselves, but it feels very out of nowhere. But underneath this joy and celebration is something dark. Everyone seems to have this lower level of fear and apprehension- as if they have seen something terrifying and dangerous. Whatever has happened- I have a suspicion I&#39;m not meant to know what happened. Wait- Computer Encrypt Log and restrict access to Shoto Arishi only. End Log.</div></span>

I was involved with a couple of away missions during that to say the least I hope I never half to be in a war zone like that again. We successfully prevented the coup then we went after woyo, we had her in custody me and lieutenant moltan had her securely in our grasp but lieutenant king convinced us to let go and allow her some dignity. That was a mistake she assaulted lieutenant roode and ran off down a tunnel with a deep chasm where she eventually threw her self down. I wish I had held on so she could face justice and go to prison. But she chose the easy way out up side is she won’t ever threaten the federation again so small win I guess I still feel partly responsible for letting that happen anyway that’s about all I have.

Entry#004, Subject: Past, Present, and Future

Everytime I sat down by the windows in the mess hall, I would sometimes tend to think of my great grandfather. Early in his days in Starfleet he can get brash, impatient, and would lack the disciple in himself; I almost tend to think I&#39;m becoming exactly what he was before he became what he had ment to be: Being a leader, and learn how to handle the mistakes and the consequences. 

For present day the camping trip I invited almost everyone on went smoothly and for awhile as we sat down by the campfire we started talking about if never had we ever done something in our lives, my ex cheating on me during high school for example. I was so close to telling her about my feelings before she went completely off the map. We came just in time to see Lt. Maggie and Ensign Shar married for the rest of their lives, though frankly I never gotten the chance to ask them for the time to chat nor did I ask any women to dance. Now to be honest I would feel left out and disappointed, but for everyone present and for two galactic power couple I choose to show pride and content for them.

The future.....oh the future endeavours I have to think about. I went down the holodeck to get an idea from one of grandpa&#39;s old hazard team simulations, with myself put into the picture. The results show some promise and I shared what I had experienced with the rest of the crewmembers, sara told me and I quote &quot;There is always something very surreal about reliving the past, and it will always mean more to you than it will other people&quot;. 
Her words had given me the extra boost I needed to move forward in my life and my career....and who knows? Perhaps I might find myself in a.....technically somewhat in a same romantic position as almost everyone else here.
But for now, I must have some patience and keep myself in control. 
I wish to see what all this will take me.

Entry#005, Subject: We All Fall Down

Good news and bad news.

The good news is I made a friend in the Tactical Hub. From what I can tell he is a mix of Betazoid and Vulcan, a Beta-Vulcan? Anyways, he seemed to be a good, hardworking type of guy, and I even volunteered to assist him with the shuttlecraft weapons array assessments.
I even overheard him becoming a duty officer because of his fast thinking and his extended knowledge on the tactical side of things, and he seems to be ready for away team training for when the time comes. I for one am proud of him, but at the same time, I am admittedly envious of him, but it&#39;s all good.

Now as for the bad news...well. My mother, Lucille Monroe...was killed in a shuttlecraft accident along with several other people involved, she died before she even made it to the emergency room. And what&#39;s worse, the commanders who were down in the hub to inspect saw me go out of the room so I could check on the Deck 3 hallway panel for a quick check up and back. 
This was an unacceptable move of me and Commander Dune was so embarrassed and pissed that he gave me the dress down of what I did which didnt give a good impression on Commander A&#39;aehrel. He even mentioned about the other time which I abandoned my post in the battle bridge during a red alert and gave me a real warning that if I had ever abandon my duties again for the third time, he will discharge me from service.

Point is he was right, so was Lieutenant Sa&#39;val, I shouldn&#39;t just quit when the commanders were present. I was lucky to be dismissed from duty by Sa&#39;val because he knew that I was unable to grieve for my mothers passing and that I should take the time and do so.

I&#39;ve made too many mistakes here and there, but this is why I&#39;m here. I learn from my errors and try not to repeat them, and perhaps grandpa did the same thing too...probably.

This is my warning from me to you: Dont do anything you&#39;ll regret. Please.

Though I shouldn&#39;t have done and sent the note to the CTOs office and just come in there with Commander Dune already gotten the message. But what&#39;s done is done and I can&#39;t do anything about it now. 

The best thing to do is to move on and prevent any further bumps from happening, and Commander Dune is certainly the guy who almost means business when it comes to detail, and though we may have our differences the road to trust can be a long, and a difficult road if not traversed right. 

He is after all my superior officer and I must show some dignity, discipline and some respect which he deserves. And if I play my cards right he will lighten up to me in some way.

Whenever the time comes I&#39;ll be sure to make my grandfather proud

My return to Phoenix so far has been... normal enough. I see that my crew - most of them - have returned from shore leave fresh, happy and ready to face the challenges that lie ahead of us. That is most pleasing; they well deserve this period of respite after all they have been through thus far. I admire their bravery, their determination and their resilience - traits which the crew in its entirety has demonstrated, and continues to demonstrate, unswervingly. 

As for myself? Suffice to say that things have not been easy, on my conscience or on my psyche. The apparitions that plagued me at night have gone, at least, and in that I find comfort. But my mind turns to other things - things considerably more negative in nature.

The guilt is most potent. It is... crushing. Knowing that I could have, and almost did, kill six good men and women out of negligence brings a feeling most horrible - a weight upon the shoulders ever growing. A weight upon the conscience. 

Worse still comes the knowledge that, in her helping me, I deprived the fleet of its best counsellor. Admiral Phenna Ephrix can no longer do what she does best, to love and be kind in abundance and give the same to others, to give <em>life</em> to others - while asking none in return. I shudder to think how those who were especially close to her would react to the news of her near-death.</span>

Some might believe that I’m hardly worth saving - that perhaps there should have been more dire consequences to my actions... and <em>in</em>actions. That perhaps I ought to be spending my time on Kaminar as a civilian, working at my aunt’s small establishment. Life would be so much simpler. 

Dare affirm their beliefs? 

Strangely enough, I do not currently know for certain. <em>Am</em> I worthy of my title, my rank, my uniform? Let this good crew down I have - and because of that it has been by no means easy to face each and every one of them as I pass them in the hallways, meet their eyes over a meal or otherwise. I despise the feeling so - and yet at the same time I feel little motivation to try and change that. Small retribution, I suppose one might call it, for what I’ve done. A reminder of what <em>cannot</em> be repeated.

Nonetheless, uncertain though I might be, of myself and my convictions, push on I must. The Tactical department needs me. They need a leader - and Starfleet Command had been gracious enough to allow me to fill these familiar shoes. 

If I must muster up some semblance of my old courage and composure and wear it like a mask then so be it. They need a leader, a pillar of support - and  for their sake and betterment that is what I shall endeavor to be. For them, my own struggles must be set side. 

Even as they tear my heart asunder.

Am I worthy of my title, my rank and my uniform? I suppose the answer, for now, lies over the horizon. 

The very, very <em>distant</em> horizon.</span>

Entry#006, Subject: Mountain High, Valley Low

This trip has left me with a cold shoulder. I would&#39;ve expected my first time being on a Class P planet would prove to be exciting, but instead we were lead into a blizzard full of problems.

The gust of wind almost blew us away like paper flying out of the room and we barely have the time to collect some biological samples there.

Sara, oh poor sara she ended up twisting her ankle from the hole in the snow, and oh man you do not want to hear her cursing in her Norse tounge, that would be the last thing I&#39;d want to hear when I asked her if she was alright.

I managed to hold the ropes long enough for them to reach the bottom and by the time we got back to the ship, all those problems we had down there just seem to pierce my own conscience and my confidence in myself. My visit to sara didnt seem to make me feel better, and me leaving her didnt help matter either and that left me with a cold icy shoulder.

If things were different all I can say is: I hope you can forgive me.

End of Line...</span>

Subject: Frostbite and Broken Branches

The trip to Hexalion IV couldn&#39;t&#39;ve been timed better for rather bleak reasons. My Aunt Janna passed from a neck injury not long ago and due to The Phoenix&#39;s location I wasn&#39;t able to attend the funeral in person or even over video. This has left me incredibly shaken but I simply can&#39;t stop working, I have to prove to my new crew mates that I am a serious worker and dedicated to my job because as much as I&#39;d like to think I&#39;m part of the crew, I&#39;m still a greenie with things to prove. I can&#39;t take a break either, the minute I&#39;m not talking to someone my eyes burn and my throat tightens up. This entire situation is so ridiculously [censored] I don&#39;t know what to do.

I visited the holodeck and walked through the forest until my hands were red and I lost feeling up to my elbows. I don&#39;t know when to stop do I? I think I held a branch so tightly that my palm bled though I didn&#39;t notice until halfway through my shift. I feel like Janna took my vocal cords with her, I shouldn&#39;t be able to sing anymore, at least not without her to sing with me. I don&#39;t know what I&#39;ll do when we have shore leave back on earth, when I have to see my parents, maybe I&#39;ll just avoid them. I might call them if I get the chance or just buzz my hair as emotional compensation.

If the frostbite in my chest could take my pain away I&#39;d very much appreciate it.</span>

And since Mal is still M.I.A there’s nothing wrong with going on a bit of a walk. If it weren’t Risa, I’d Wanna get married right here on this desolate region. Not another human for miles. Me and Maggie set up camp, and we plan on staying here for the rest of the day, until we go back to the Phoenix, where, hopefully Malcolm will be ready to go. I try not to think about him too much while he’s working, the ship’s taken a beating; he wants to help out the starbase crew. He has to learn the operations of this vessel if he intends to be a great assistant chief engineer.</div>

<div class="pre pre--multiline nohighlight"> My first few weeks aboard the Pheonix started out normal as far as I could tell. But the incident with the Tal Shiar certainly was the highlight. On my first three away missions I nearly died twice or more, however it has done little to waver my resolve. Perhaps even proven my value in those missions though I have yet to hear any verification for those heroics but I am certain I may. On other topics... I have adopted two baby Sulcata tortoises, and I very well know they are a life time pet. But I have determined that being a mostly to myself person, they would be perfect for me.

So...today’s the big day! My first day on the job! I already went through my physical, as embarrassing as it is, now I’m just waiting for the department head to show up. I’m so excited! But also nervous! I wish there was a word to describe those combination of emotions, but the closest I can get is anxious-

Oh no, I’m rambling again. I really need to learn when to stop talking. 

Ensign T’Pruk, out.

<div class="pre pre--multiline nohighlight"> I thought it was something I did wrong, but it doesn’t seem to be; Malcolm has left. In the note he left me, he said he was going back to earth. We didn’t even get a chance to say goodbye in person. He gave me a necklace I promised I’d never take it off, and I never will. The only place I felt comfortable going to was the Observation lounge on deck two. But I guess I really just wanna get off the ship altogether, me and that man have been everywhere together, and it’s made me feel like I don’t belong on this ship, but of course I’m staying on.. it’s just Mal gave me this sort of.. energy to keep going; now that he’s gone, it’s gonna take a while for that energy to rejuvenate itself if it does at all. </div></span>

<div class="pre pre--multiline nohighlight">I’m actually starting to mesh with the crew I think. After the *Ibn Fadlan* was lost I didn’t think I’d find a home again. I’ve lost every home I’ve found in one way or another for one reason or another. That was the life I chose all those years ago but Starfleet gave me a chance to take back control in my life and even more they gave me the chance to have a home. To give me a life where I didn’t have to run. On the flip side, I don’t exactly feel like I have many friends in the classical sense. I miss Jai. He’s dead though, so are the rest of them. Even if he was alive it’s not like I could pen a letter. “Hey Jai, it’s your ex-girlfriend, you know the one who was going to marry you then ditched you at DS9 to defect to the Federation”. Great conversation starter. Probably better that he’s dead. Temptation is a dangerous thing. Friendship and companionship like I used to have though, will be hard to find in Starfleet. A home is better than none though. End log.</div></span>

Stardate: Recorded before they left for the observation lounge

<div class="pre pre--multiline nohighlight">I am glad to have come aboard this star ship. Not only is there a wealth of information, there is remarkable camaraderie aboard as well. Despite my lack of social experience, I have been able to build a rapport with quite a few of my fellow crewmembers... Although, I find it hard to admit, there is one in particular I have gotten to known well, quickly I might add, they are Ensign Ga&#39;HaTz, they are Klingon like me, however I am only half, and they share a deep love for knowledge and learning with me. While I had quickly made a bad habit of doing most of the talking, quite illogical, I know, the knowledge they have shared with me is invaluable. Most of our meetings have gone on like, what some might call, &#39;study sessions&#39;, endlessly talking about our knowledge and sharing it with the other, taking notes, and... I have talked about such academic things with my mother and colleagues on the colony, but this is different, I am unsure how to describe the differences currently, but they are there and observable. I do not feel like I am being talked down to, and while one can build a friendship with their guardians, there is always that connection of being in their care. Ga&#39;HaTz, however, has seen me as an  equal, perhaps a superior with how they act around me. Such behavior is somewhat understandable since I am above them in rank, however they act with a noticeable anxiety that is illogical, however, their continued contact with me despite such anxieties is a true mark of bravery. With such intelligence, kindness, and bravery. I feel I can admit, albeit it would be hard to do so, that we are becoming fast friends. And I cannot wait to learn more. End Log</div></span>

Stardate: Supplemental 
<div class="pre pre--multiline nohighlight">This has all happened very fast, my new friend, Ensign Ga&#39;HaTz has asked me out on a date, unfortunately I was unable to respond before they had to go to work. I do no not what to do with this information, I am experiencing cardiac palpitations, my pupils are dilated, and my thoughts are filled with them. Also the anger I feel towards Commander T&#39;Svai has yet to subside. She speaks as if she knows everything- yes she is knowledgeable, which is admirable, however, knowing everything is impossible. She gives me the same feeling I have around my cousins, however she does not seem to hold the same malice towards me as they do. None the less, it is hard to think of a logical reason as to why Ga&#39;HaTz was drawing me- next thing I know they&#39;ll be reciting poetry to me- which to those who do not know, is the traditional romantic gesture for male Klingons, or perhaps they will try to fight me, traditional for females- I am unsure. 
Their eyes are like star light 
the stars in the sky follow them
My sky had colour, galaxies, nebulas applenty
but there is a simplicity
in the late night
in finding a common constellation
for its stars shine so bright
the aura surrounds you
despite being light years away
I will find you
I will study you
I will fill every library
With knowledge of the stars
but keep you to myself
your light is easy to find
your light may be public
but your secrets shall be mine.

<div class="pre pre--multiline nohighlight"> So today was me and Malcolm’s first date back together. And honestly. It went muck smoother that I thought it would, It was like he never left. As soon as we agreed to rekindle our relationship; there we were going on a date like none of it ever happened. A quarter of me feels like that’s a bad thing. But the rest of me doesn’t want things to be awkward. Just hoping I start training for counselor soon. </div>

<div class="pre pre--multiline nohighlight"> I did it, I pitched my idea to Sara. Granted she probably thinks it’s impossible but she agreed to work with me on it. Had I been doing this alone, this little side project might take decades, but with a team of people behind me. I might be able to finish it in say.. 6 years? Give or take. I’m so excited to get underway. I just hope the captain likes my idea just as much.</div>

<div class="pre pre--multiline nohighlight">On some level, I miss the capitalist hellscape of home. At least then if I messed up, it&#39;d be someone else&#39;s problem to deal with. Ethnical standards of the Federation were easy enough to pass in an academic situation. &#39;Say this&#39;, &#39;Do this&#39;, easy enough to bluff through. But now? Well I&#39;m at an impasse. A Commanding Officer is refusing my medical advice and insisting she can handle her condition. As it stands, it&#39;s minor. But getting worse. With proper management and some therapeutics, she could be back to full operation in a matter of days, but she&#39;d need to be out of commission during those, a state she sees as unacceptable.

In theory, if she manages her temperature correctly and reduces her workload, she&#39;ll avoid any serious risk. However, I have little reason to believe she will follow through on this. Theassu are typically stubborn in their own right, engineers more so. Her attitude was dismissive and, if I&#39;m honest, downright insulting. Though I&#39;ve had worse. -What does &#39;Son of a Pink Blooded Zeltan&#39; even mean?- Oh, computer, forget that bit.

Anyways, I&#39;ll be looking for a second opinion on this before I take any action. While I officially have the right to order any crew to bedrest, even a CO, I don&#39;t know if I can risk the reputation and the possible blowback. Particularly if my own CO disagrees with me.

So, ultimately, I have three choices. I could technically just contact them on comms and order them to bedrest right now. Poor form, but within my rights. I could wait for the opinion of another of my colleagues and act from there. Or I could simply leave the COO to her own devices.

The third option is callous and would only work on Freecloud, not here. It&#39;s right out. My ethical classes would say that the first option is mandatory. But my experience with people says to not risk it and wait for support. But every minute I waste deliberating increases the risk.

Computer, that&#39;s all. Er- Stop? Oh-!</div>

<div class="pre pre--multiline nohighlight"> Talking to my fellow officers has reminded me about something I have not though about in years. My bio parents. What I have learned from conversations is that I am far from the only person on the ship who is adopted. Still as far as I can tell I am the only person with no ties to their bio family. Deimora has her twin brother, Nikki had her brothers and grandma, and Newt at least knows about his bio father and is planning on sending a message to his bio mother. I do not know specifics, but I don&#39;t think anyone else here was abandoned in their first few hours of life due to a physical deformity. I know nothing about my past before become a Howard, besides the fact that my bio family could not be located on records at the time and that they were probably bad people. It sounds like I&#39;m complaining, which I don&#39;t mean to do. I have a loving family that cares for me and supports me. Probably if I tried I could find out more but I don&#39;t really want that. They left me in an alley, I don&#39;t want to know who they are. Still I wish I could talk to someone about it without killing the mood and making everyone uncomfortable.</div></span>

She appears stable but, oh Elements, I am exhausted already. I can do my job fine, but I&#39;m going to need a good ale and a few rounds of Pixit to calm me down after all this. Perhaps the Thaessu might be able to repay me for her negligence by helping us both relax. Might do some good to get us both on better footing and in a better relationship.

Not here to make enemies, probably here to make friends, but always down for running a Thaessu through some hoops. As professionally as a Starfleet Officer can, of course.</div>

<div class="pre pre--multiline nohighlight">I. Am. Tired. I love my work but looming over the body of a being I can&#39;t even scan is exhausting. I&#39;ve tried every type of signal I can think of and I see no response. Nothing I can use to make a call. It&#39;s exhausting and a little bit boring. The patient clearly is having issues, she&#39;s bleeding stardust after all, but meanwhile I need to figure out what to do and have nothing to work on.

Thank the Elements for Lt. JG Amy Olson. I think my heart would have broken and my patient would be dead without her encouragement and guidance. At least, it feels like that. Q are truly a form of Demon of Air and Fire.</div></span>

<div class="pre pre--multiline language-ini">[Today was my first away mission. I jumped on the opportunity as soon as it came my way and I was not disappointed. While setting up equipment on the planet, we had first contact with a humanoid race. Can you believe it?! First contact on my first mission? The whole situation enthralls me so! The two of them were trying to contact our ship by using a rocket. It ended up exploding and starting a major fire. It was horrifying to watch but none of us could do anything untill we got the go ahead from the captain. The fear of destroying your starfleet career is so prevelent, I think we would have watched those two die in terror. I am embarrassed Abit that I didn&#39;t just go and help them immediately. I just was so terrified of the consequences... of not being able to continue being a Starfleet Anthropologist.... ...Anyway, I am hoping I will be able to interview them tomorrow after debriefing. My research into them could put me in the spotlight in my field. I really hope I am able to get this opportunity. 
I met alot of interesting people today. Charlie is a very intriguing person and I would love to interview him more sometime. He expressed disdain for Vulcans but suddenly spoke to the commander in Vulcan which seemed to surprise her as well. It will be facinating to observe the two in the future. My main concern right now is Lithop. As a Half-Betazoid, I could feel her fear and sadness. It started at the beginning of the mission and seemed to have gotten worse once we got back. I am concerned about what is bothering her and I am resolved to talk to her tomorrow about it although I&#39;m not sure how to approach her. One thing is for certain, things are going to get much more interesting now. Briar out.]</div></span>

<div class="pre pre--multiline nohighlight">If I&#39;m bein&#39; honest, I&#39;m quite uncertain what to do. News travel fast, and I heard about what happened to Phenna some time ago. I probably used the &#39;work&#39; excuse to myself a bit too much these past few days, and still haven&#39;t gotten to talk to her. Honestly, I&#39;m not sure I should... I mean, if I was dyin&#39;, I would greatly want any kind of distractions, y&#39;know? But she probably get enough of them already... She didn&#39;t seem to be the type to mind and I did ask her and got as an answer she didn&#39;t mind, though it was before the latest event, but... yeah, it&#39;s really just my fault. I know it always feel good to share somethin&#39; with someone else when you&#39;ve been keepin&#39; it for some time to yourself. 
I still have yet to look at pictures of dad- Thomas- with, huh, the Commander. Gotta ask her somethin&#39;, too. I&#39;d feel better about knowin&#39; how much she mind in the case I accidently let slip anythin&#39; about our relationship, y&#39;know. Am just too clumsy not too, probably... kinda surprised I didn&#39;t yet, actually, haha! Well, medical supplies can&#39;t repeat what you&#39;ve told them so.... anyway! I&#39;m not sure I&#39;m comfortable everyone knowin&#39;, I mean the crew are good peeps but everyone&#39;s got their own reaction to &quot;that ensign is the cmo/my boss/colleague/third officer&#39;s son&quot;, y&#39;know? Telling Phenna though is different. Absolutely not in link with her (former) rank or what she&#39;s... she just, y&#39;know... have the listenin&#39; vibes:tm:, yeah? I just hope I can stop chickenin&#39; out before it&#39;s, y&#39;know, too late? Sometimes, I&#39;m just too good at keeping my anxieties away? And then they come tumblin&#39; down on me harder later, haha- ha... aaaand I&#39;m just fallin&#39; down that same good ol&#39; self-aware-yet-&quot;can&#39;t&quot;-do-crap hole again so movin&#39; on huuuuh-</div></span>

<div class="pre pre--multiline nohighlight"> In response to a Q&#39;s assertion - this I believe to be Phenna, unless we have had another Q aboard -  that Gramen had an untapped energy source, and in keeping with my theory regarding the planet&#39;s possible life status as a result of its species unique interaction with it, I attempted to meld with a volcano today even after reading no life signs and even climbing into the interior without seeing any signs of life. It was unsuccessful, as logic would dictate, as one cannot meld with something that does not live. To have anticipated any other outcome was an act of desperation, and was illogical.

I believe my logic has weakened in response to a deep desire to ensure that the inhabitants of this planet, who have proven to be intelligent - building a rocket and laboratory within what in effect is only twenty years of technological development from the start of their civilization - and overwhelmingly friendly. It seems likely they would prove highly useful allies once they have reached warp development, which by all rights could occur within as little as forty years at their current rate. I intend to continue to investigate, and shall perhaps seek Phenna out for further clarification, if the warning was indeed hers. 

I do not wish to feel the death of this planet, nor see the other telepaths on this vessel experience such a thing.

<span class="pre pre--inline">I will start this log by saying that making voice logs like this is a new concept to me. Even on a former Galaxy class such as the Venture didn’t require its ensigns to log themselves, however it was strongly advised. 

Due to this being a new posting, I find things to be a bit harder to adjust than anticipated. This ship is configured differently than the Venture in almost every way. However, that being said, I should be acquainted with the ship and its layout within the next couple weeks. 

My first day on duty on Phoenix was during the last few days of the Gramen Incident, while I was getting acquainted with the ship’s systems and the sheer complexity of her engines. It is a welcome challenge, one I hope to overcome within my first few months on Phoenix. 

Commander Higgins, my department head, is liberated Borg, though I will admit that aspect of her isn’t what intimidates me. Rather, it is her sheer size and stealthiness that startles me most. She is 6 feet 8 inches tall and somehow silent as a mouse, which has on a number of occasions, startled me while I was working. She is as sweet as a gumdrop and cuter than a button, though, so all is forgiven in that respect. I can only assume that because she can be naturally intimidating with her Borg enhancements and her size, that she is deliberately nicer to people around her so they are a little less afraid of her, which is understandable. I doubt she’d accept due to a chain of command issue, but if by any chance she’d need to talk to someone about her experience with the Borg, I’d be happy to lend an ear. I doubt I’d be able to dish out any helpful advise, but sometimes letting it out can help begin that healing process. I dunno. I’m an engineer, not a councilor. There are far more qualified folks than I who can handle that subject. 

End log.</span></span>

<div class="pre pre--multiline nohighlight">I think S&#39;val would be proud of my initial efforts here. The crew members I&#39;ve met so far have all been kind and well-spoken, making it easy for me to attempt socialization. In particular, the ship&#39;s doctor strikes me as someone I would very much enjoy speaking with at length, as does Lieutenant Kallie and Lieutenant Sara, though I must be more careful around Ms. Sara. I&#39;ve been too open with her already, and while S&#39;val has impressed upon me that I need to &#39;open up&#39; a bit more, I see no need to be quite that forthcoming. Only a few days into my new posting and already a member of the crew knows about my personal... quandaries. I received an invitation to have drinks with Dr. Carlisle, and I can only hope that she has not been warned of my secrets ahead of time. Time will tell, I suppose. Tomorrow, after drinks, I need to remember to send a reply to S&#39;val and another to Ada &amp; Papa and yet another to Sutal. If I have time, I will read some more of Footprints on a Silver Lake (kindly recommended by Meros, who I&#39;m sure meant nothing by it and intends no harm and absolutely isn&#39;t sending me thinly veiled threats by the STARS why did I ever take him at his word-- never mind, I&#39;m on a tangent). I hope to finish it soon, so that I can write an appropriately cutting response to my dear brother. For now, sleep, and hopefully tomorrow I will continue to become more acquainted with the Phoenix and her crew.</div></span>

That I should care more about the people I&#39;m studying. Is it really right to just be an observer? Should I be trying to interact more as myself and not as an anthropologist?

<div class="pre pre--multiline nohighlight"> It has been quite some time now since I&#39;ve made one of these, hasn&#39;t it? Yes. It is.

The past few weeks have been... emotional. No, that doesn&#39;t quite capture the meaning of it. The essence of it. Our encounter with the planet of Gramen and the four races which call her home was certainly different. One does not normally watch a planet tear itself asunder and become four different worlds each on their own... and then bear witness as its people achieve what can only be described as transcendance and open doors to countless opportunities ahead of them. They possess differences; primordial divides that have prevented each other thus far from coming together - but if the people of Earth and the two discrete races on my world are any indication to go by, there is no gap so wide that it cannot be bridged; with time, understanding and acceptance as the building blocks. I wish them well - and hope that someday they will truly be able to join the rest of the galactic community. 

And then... there was the death of Phenna Ephrix. Sweet, kind, warm Phenna Ephrix, whose patience, care and love for those around her were so great that they were, and I believe shall ever remain, legendary. I gave a eulogy on the crew&#39;s behalf at her funeral; simple, heartfelt and to the point, I hope. For someone like her, words failed, and I believe shall ever fail, to sufficiently represent what she stood for. The greatest monuments, to any one person or people&#39;s legacy, are not made of stone or marble or any other material thing; the greatest and brightest of these exists in the form of moral values; a way of life. She taught us to be kind, to love and to accept; the greatest monument to her legacy would be for us to one day be as she was; and in honoring her memory she remains alive, in a metaphysical sense. We are all blessed to have known her. May she rest in peace, and find in what lies beyond what she could not in life.</div></span>

In them I am glad to see that the flame of Phoenix remains stubbornly undying. I tell my colleagues that these young people will be the forefront of Starfleet long after our time has come; and I don&#39;t think that prediction will ever cease to remain relevant. 

As for myself, well, I have had much to think about and much happen to me in that same period of time. Watching the crew grow closer together, and with encouragement from those closest to me, I have been trying to reach out to the rest of the crew. After all, if they are to look to me as their liaison to the Captain and their superior, there must be that trust first and foremost - and I would like to believe that I am on the way there. 

But on a deeper personal level - I have taken time to consider certain aspects of my outlook on life. Looking upon what I did and who I used to be has not been easy. I think it would not be for anyone in my shoes. Nonetheless. It is mortal to err and it is mortal to live with the fallout; but it is also mortal to grow and change oneself following such - and that is what I shall do. The could have and would have has already come and gone. What matters is the can be, and the here and now. I am First OFficer of the Phoenix. I am a colleague, a friend... and hopefully, soon, a little more than that. I can be who I once was. I can be more. I look to the future - and I will endeavor to keep things that way.

E cineribus, ad astra. Color me sentimental, color me boring - but the funny thing is, somehow, even for just these few moments, I don&#39;t care. I think it fitting.</div></span>

<div class="pre pre--multiline nohighlight">I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m thinking here.  I&#39;ve never done one of these for the ship up until this point, but I figured why not get my thoughts out there and documented somewhat.  It&#39;s not like anyone really reads these unless searching for some sort of imposter or sign of things going wrong.

I guess I have a few questions that I&#39;m scared to voice.  Although I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m scared or just don&#39;t think it&#39;s my place to comment.  How is it that I feel so...  useless around everyone.  I worked at a shipyard for a few years before attending this ship, but I have no experience being on a ship before this one.  Stayed on Earth to support my siblings and be there for my parents...  being the eldest wasn&#39;t something I was asking for, but it was something I was responsible for anyways.  I decided to take a risk and join an exploration and science ship...  I wanted to stay away from blood and trauma that comes with war.  But today I was privy to seeing the room in which our captain had been tortured for who knows how long.  We can&#39;t trace the culprits at this point and I haven&#39;t been able to hear any news on the Captain.  I&#39;m worried.  Everyone says things will be fine and to do our jobs.  I did that.  I scanned every micro-millimetere that I could think of.  I even tried to get a sample of what the left behind objects were made of.  I know it won&#39;t matter in the long run because everything I discovered comes up to a moot point.  There&#39;s nothing to tie anyone or species.  Ensign Virol Ota was able to ascertain a signature of some sort of discharge.  At least that could be useful.  It was gone before I could also analyze it.  

I cried a bit.  I held back my tears a little, but I know they were still on the corners of my eyes after it hit me.I know I&#39;ll probably get in trouble for it later...  especially if it happens again.  I hate being human.  Scratch that, I hate being different than my dad.  He wouldn&#39;t cry.</div></span>

Senior Officer status does not seem to be as I expected, and while I am not in a position to create a formal work log, as I do not trust this function to format such a log appropriately and using a PADD is currently not an option, this will serve as an informal record for the time being. Hm. Delete the prior sentence. I am the only one with access to this log, therefore that is redundant. Delete the last sentence and the one currently being spoken. 

I am in an unusual position, and one I did not ever anticipate being in. I led an away mission that has the potential to be interpreted as a violation of the Prime Directive in which there was no sense of chain of command and where several of my orders were openly contradicted, which is both puzzling and concerning even to a Vulcan - strange that such artifice is even entering my logs. But to get to the point.

In a sense the gravitons ignited a warp core, as far as I am able to interpret. The away team fled away from the shockwave and were transported two at a time back aboard the ship due to some sort of interference. Ensign Briar received a shrapnel wound to the side. I was hit by the shockwave and injured by shrapnel. Other crew members received various other minor injuries. Emotionally, nobody is unscathed, that is, none of those who can experience - no. None of us. I cannot in good conscience recommend becoming involved in this conflict, particularly since the Phoenix cannot leave orbit and the Crix’oid’s account of their war is so dissimilar to the so-called Azvahdellian’s account of their ‘beast’ that an offer of alliance is bound to create risk. Oh – the Crix’oids claimed that they were descended from some… non-corporeal entity. One that sought to protect the planet from creatures like us via the shield generator. The Azvahdellians attempted to colonize the planet, resulting in the war. And then there’s the issue of the sewers. In the city, there is some sort of work occurring in the sewers. That should be investigated. 
Yes, that should be enough to serve as a mnemonic device. Computer, end log.</div></span>

Tasks: 
- Work log for crix&#39;oid planet
- Torpedo bay repair log
- Failure mode analysis, bridge, personal performance
- Ask Captain about red beam, shuttle attack
- Apologize
- Prepare recommendation of alternate second officer candidate in event of demotion (alternate third if Higgins promoted), low priority
- Recommend contacting Command about specifics, inquire about similar events if any

Shuttle attack, known problems:
- Unidentified electrical signal, emitter composed of shuttle parts
- Intrusion of unknown entity capable of causing physical harm
- Shuttle temperature and humidity change
- Shuttle lights non-operational
- Destruction of computer system prior to landing
- No shuttle damage
- No organic particles
- Remote piloting back to Phoenix

Recent attack, known problems: 
- Failure to evade, pursuit capable at high warp, with interruption of warp field
- Ship of unknown construction, origin
- No life signs. Remotely piloted?
- Supported by ability to maintain orbit at full impulse
- Unidentified shield-weakening heat-producing weaponry
- Counterhack affected environmental systems, producing heat, humidity
- Weakened by reverse tractor beam polarity, direct targeting of engines by multiple ships
- Returned to unknown source

Surely any link upheld almost exclusively by common unknown elements is a tenuous one? Avoid wishful thinking that excuses personal failure. There remains a possibility that ship and shuttle affected by similar source. More data needed.  </div></span>

After the most recent attack on Phoenix, I must admit I’m getting wary of the Captain’s ability to lead in her injured state. That’s not to say I’d question her orders, but the simple fact that she was willing to sacrifice Lieutenant Junior Grade Malcolm Parsons, who had gotten married the same day, mind you, so we could get into friendly space makes me wonder if she’d sacrifice the rest of engineering if another attack occurred, much less someone who wasn’t JUST MARRIED. *sigh* I’m aware that I’m in no place to question my captain in any capacity, and I’m also aware that I’m opening myself up to disciplinary action from the command staff, but the safety of the crew is supposed to be the captain’s top priority, so it makes me wonder how expendable we down in the lower decks really are.

<div class="pre pre--multiline nohighlight"> Malcolm, is clean as a whistle, let’s get that out of the way. I don’t know how he was revived or who did it. But I don’t think that’s something I want to touch on right now. The captain, has been good to me; and to the rest of this crew. She endangered her health further, to keep this vessel safe. I’m simply going to overlook that day, my husband was acting as an engineer and as a member of the crew. I have no right to question the captain’s decision for I have never been in the command chair in real life, I cannot possibly understand the weight that the chair places on one’s shoulders. Command in medical, is definitely different from command on the bridge. I won’t let this experience effect my relationship with my captain.</div>

Ensign Nedras, Tactical
Stardate: 154980.03

<div class="pre pre--multiline nohighlight">Okay, personal logs. Where to start? I think I feel... happy. Excited. Even while docked, the Phoenix is like nothing I could have imagined. Here, the Gamma Quadrant is a distant memory in every possible sense, save for a single Jem&#39;Hadar medic, and even then, he too is clearly changed by Starfleet. 

Already, I&#39;ve met most of the senior staff and a great number of commissioned officers. I believe they accept me - or at least, most of them. Security and Intelligence wouldn&#39;t be doing their jobs if they didn&#39;t behave... well, like Security and Intelligence do. It is saddening, but understandable, and more than outweighed by receiving a holiday gift the CSO during our very first meeting. Besides that, it&#39;s very hard to be intimidated by it all when you&#39;ve seen the COS in a fluffy red robe and some very peculiar books - actually, best not to expand on that. 

I&#39;ve spent some time looking at the tactical hub-shield system interface and phaser guidance system. And, admittedly, some time looking at the holodecks. And the replicators. It&#39;s bound to become all the more exciting once we depart. Records say it&#39;s bound to become dangerous as well, but that&#39;s hardly new. That&#39;s what the Academy is there to prepare us for.

I think if my predecessor had gotten this far he&#39;d give this assignment everything he could give. I will too, in his memory. 

Pebbles, the computer isn&#39;t going to register your meowing as language.

In order to keep my mind off of the situation with Lieutenant Parsons, which has undoubtedly effected me more than it probably should have, I’ve been working diligently on the shuttle craft that Commander Higgins assigned to me. I’ve figured out a way to modify an older Kirk-era Klingon disruptor array to work with the LCARS operating system and on Starfleet frequencies, however that leaves an issue as to the power source. With the tractor beam, the shield generator, weapons and warp drive I’d need *at least* a Class 3 Lockheed Y-24 similar to the ones on the Interceptor class ships 100 years ago, however I don’t think a Y24 would be able to fit within the parameters Commander Higgins provided. I would need to figure out how to downsize something like the Y24 while still offering at least 80 petawatts to operate all of the aforementioned systems on top of life support and navigation, not including impulse drives. I’ll need to follow up with Commander Higgins on the matter once we leave space dock. 

On a different point, I’d like to apologize for the things I’ve said about the Captain in my last log. I was out of line, and I hope she can forgive me. My actions were... childish, and unbecoming of a starfleet officer, regardless of rank. I realize she only did what she did for the betterment of the ship, sacrificing 1 life to save more than a thousand more and her ship. If I were in her position... I don’t think I’d have been able to make that call, and I commend her strength.

Ah, huh, anyway, moving on~ I&#39;ve just ended a call with my moms for Christmas!!! They sent me more non-replicated peaches, I&#39;m so, so, so happy!!!

<div class="pre pre--multiline nohighlight">I don’t know how often the other crew members record logs, but I like to keep records of things, so... here we go.
Day four- five? A day that starts with ‘f’ onboard Phoenix has come to a close- oh, also yesterday was Christmas… that’s probably worth mentioning. I bought Tessk a gift the day before when I stopped by spacedock, and he returned the favor with probably more than I deserve- though I will not deny my appreciation for his fine taste in fruit and springwine. (Personal goal: find someone to share it with.)

There’s been a lot of speculation about another Iconian war- I say ‘speculation’ as if the ship isn’t perpetually on yellow alert now. I won’t lie, it’s making me a bit nervous. Wait- do security or intelligence listen to these things? Then I am totally not scared at all of a looming war with the Iconians. Not at all. I am very ready.
… I hope whoever’s listening enjoyed that, and if you’re any good at your job you could probably tell it was sarcasm anyway.
I just left a spontaneous meeting with a few other members of the crew- mostly from tactical, though the first officer showed up too. I felt a little- no, a lot- out of place… but being a junior scientist in pre-wartime will do that to you, I guess. Oh- reminder to start in-depth research on neutronium tomorrow.

I started this log thinking it would help me sort out my thoughts, but I think I’m just more confused now. There’s so much going on, and now tactical is going to start scheduling shipwide drills- reminder number two, contact someone from medical about first aid training.
It’s just a lot to walk in on. Maybe now that my roommate’s onboard I’ll have someone to talk to about it who doesn’t have experience onboard or some kind of combat training I’ll never be able to match in a million years.

I should stop talking. I’ve got some invincible Iconian alloy to research- if I want to be of any help, that is.

His name is Ensign Nedras. He’s been aboard for twelve days, by both his own account, and by Sickbay and the Quartermaster&#39;s logs. I checked. 

The officer in question is a member of the Vorta race. This species is genetically designed to be loyal to the Founders without reserve. There have been several Vorta defectors, and the Founders have generally declared that this is due to defects in the cloning process. Most of these individuals were neatly disposed of before they could do much damage from within the Dominion. Nedras seems to be among the lucky handful of ‘defective’ Vorta who’ve managed to escape the Dominion without any repercussions. 

Something felt wrong about him. He lied several times during our short conversation. I first noticed it when we spoke of the beauty of mountains. Understandable enough: the Vorta have no sense of aesthetics. He was clearly attempting to hold conversation with me. But when I began to examine the Founder’s governmental policies, he grew very uncomfortable. He was defensive of the Dominion, and seemed even frightened that I questioned the Founder’s methods. The next part of our conversation… I cannot definitively say if it was a lie or not. I asked why he left the Dominion. It brought the poor man to tears. 

They were genuine tears, I can say that for certain. The reason he gave for them, however? He said that he was afraid to die. That he knew serving the Founders would inevitably lead to his death. He said that it was extremely difficult to leave, as he was going against his hard-wired instinct to trust the Founders absolutely. It is this that worries me. Logically, it makes sense, but he was lying when he said these things. 

My suspicion is little more than a gut feeling, so I will not mention it to my superiors, for now. I don&#39;t know what it is, but Nedras is most definitely up to something.</div></span>

<span class="pre pre--inline">Happy new year! *hic* I can’t remember the last time I had this much fun by myslelf. Perhaps it’s the booze, but I know one thing, I’m definitely going to have to call out for shift to- *hic* -morrow. I must admit, I am not a fan of drinking, but with two battles in the span of 4 months and all with at least one casualty, magically revived or otherwise, tends to take a toll. And there’s talk of war with the Iconians, something I personally loathe the idea of. Though, I feel like us on the Phoenix are somehow going to be alright, whether the Q will be involved or not. I have faith in this crew, and our Captain most of all. Having survived an attack with the Iconians personally, and most importantly having survived, shows just how tough she can be. Commander Dunamis is an excellent leader, and I hope once this mess is over he gets a post of his own, perhaps a new flagship with all the new bells and whistles. Oh... look at me. I become a kissass when I’m drunk! But I suppose it must be true. 

Everyone I’ve met so far on this ship has been kind and understanding. I hope I can spend as long as possible aboard Phoenix, though I will admit it does get a bit lonely up here, away from Kianaa. I’m hoping I can get into contact with her soon, establish communications to her and keep our relationship alive. 

Part of me wonders why she transferred off of Phoenix in the first place, another part of me is just happy that she got off when she did. There was a lot of panic when the Iconians attacked, and I worry that she might’ve been overwhelmed by it all; being part Betazoid and all. Doesn’t keep me from missing her, though. 

I often envy Commander Higgins and Ensign Skye, Lieutenant Howard and Lieutenant Miller. Hell, even Lieutenant Verne and Ensign Verne. A girl can’t help but get sappy over love, and often jealous I suppose.</span></span>

[Stardate: 155046.64.]

Captain’s Log, stardate whatever the computer set it to. 

I haven’t done one of these in forever. I haven’t written any of these since Gramen. I mean, I’ve done the formal reports back to Command – they’d rather them than this I’m sure, but – I’m supposed to keep track. I need to keep track, considering that everything after Gramen is some sort of jumble in my head and none of it is in chronological order. I mean, I have an excuse for all of that, but- It would be nice to be organised, you know? It’s just. Difficult. To find the motivation to dictate all of this because whenever I do it just sounds bloody stupid. Talking to yourself. 

I need a yeoman to write these logs for me. 

I mean – like I say, I have an excuse for not writing these. I must have been captured what, at the end of November and nothing had happened in the meantime, which is surprising, because something is always happening here and it’s always something wrong happening. Pessimism, stop it! We just have a knack for drama and danger. But yes – being captured. I say being captured but it was more… Being knocked out and held aboard my own shuttle when on the way back to Earth Spacedock. My own shuttle. I know. Former Security officer and FedSec liaison and that happens. I ain’t happy about it either. 

It’s difficult to remember all of it coherently. I think it’s all out of order – like snippets of memories, almost. Different torture methods, different questions. And you know… You know what’s weird? Out all of it, I can distinctly remember the just- feeling ready to die. Accepting it, knowing it was inevitable. Except it wasn’t, obviously, because I’m still here… Talking. Talking as best I can, all things considered.&quot;</div></span>

They asked questions at Medical but- 

The Phoenix had beamed me out just after they had slit my throat. Proper- blade, deep incision, blood pouring, the works. I don’t like to think about it – but- I still do. Being so hazy but the pain tearing through it all. The feeling of warm blood. The jolt of electricity. My arm still aches even though I know it’s been fixed. It’s like – it’s like I can still feel it all, relive it all, even though it’s over. And you know what I realised? I keep seeing red. Dark blood all over me, all over the floor, just marring the interior of the shuttlecraft and but… I never even saw it. It was pitch black. I couldn’t- I couldn’t see anything. 

I don’t like- thinking about it. Remembering it, whatever it is. It’s the blood that gets me. I’ve never had an issue with blood. I’ve seen murder scenes and watched post mortems and been completely fine. I’ve seen people mangled by transporter accidents and for some reason, it’s just… I don’t know. Maybe the difference is that it was me. Because it’s not- I keep imagining the sight, but that’s not just it. It’s the feeling. It’s this… This warm, thick liquid, but it’s pouring, I can feel it rising over the wound, dripping down my neck. I can smell it. It’s just this – it’s all I can smell, so bad that I can taste it, choke on it-

I’m fine, though. Really. Medical worked their wonders – they must be literal miracle workers to have brought me back from something like that. I was out for a fair while and I don’t think I’m entirely up to date on what happened in that time. There were ups and downs. I tried to break out at one point; made it all the way to the shuttlebay too which I’d wager to say is quite the feat. Not one that I’m proud of, but still, it was… Something. 

I argued a fair bit with the medical staff. I don’t want it to become a habit but it seems to be headed that way, considering recent events. It makes me frustrated at myself. They’re just trying to do their jobs and I’m… Stubborn, impulsive, angry, and quite likely a complete and utter pest to them. …Do you ever feel as if you maybe just need to rewrite the entirety of your personality and force yourself to be someone who you’re not? I’ve been considering that recently. I can’t tell if it’s down to the brain trauma or just me. But I… I just realised how I mistreat people sometimes. Being stern is a necessity when required, but I… I want to live up to their expectations. They’ve had good commanding officers before me and- what if I’m not good enough? What if I’m not open enough, not friendly enough, too distant and withdrawn- 

I never used to worry about this. I’d say it’s the brain trauma talking, but I know it isn’t. I know it isn’t because I remember the last regret that I had and it was that I hadn’t gotten to know them better. I need to be better. 

I’m getting off track.&quot;</div></span>

The fleet ball happened and I’m rather glad I missed it. The only thing it’s good for is networking and finding out who’s importing the Romulan Ale this year. There was some sort of… First contact but not first contact; a whole issue with old space agencies and settlements and… I don’t know all of the details but I know it hurt a lot of the crew – mentally and physically. Wish I had been there for that one – or that we hadn’t attended at all. 

Then there was the Iconian attack. I was there for that. I’m not sure if we should be counting it as the second Iconian attack, all things considered, seeing as how I later found out from Starfleet Medical that they were behind my torture. You know what I don’t understand, though? The gall of them. I want to know their motives and reasoning. I want to know why they came across some Starfleet vessel and decided to batter them into submission but not finish them off. What do you think it was? Some sort of weapons test? Seeing how far they could go – ensuring that they could take us down? …I don’t know, and there is no way of knowing. …I also don’t like it. 

What made matters worse was that it was just after Olson and Parsons had been married as well. I officiated, somewhat. Ensign Ciel was my translator because I hadn’t… Don’t think about it again. It was a good ceremony. I like to think that I did pretty well for something that I made up on the spot. Felt as if I was going to collapse for the entire time, mind you, but still… It was nice until the attack.&quot;</div></span>

Kept circling us in this stupidly agile craft, attacked us with some sort of heat-ray weapon. I shouldn’t have been on the bridge. I understand why Ensign Ciel had been so angry – he was right, I was a liability there and then. But that’s a whole other topic in itself – taking command when you can’t, feeling the need to because the crew shouldn’t be left alone during a crisis of that sort. Either way, I was there. I was giving the orders as best I could. And as much as I agree I shouldn’t have been there? I’m kind of glad I was. If I hadn’t, then it would have been someone else who sent Malcolm Parsons, just newly married, off to die. 

He had an EV suit. I went through all of the scene safety with him, ensured he had the best chance. He was willing as well – the Lieutenant is every bit a Starfleet officer and I couldn’t have asked for a better person to be in that room. But still, the risk was there, and his EV suit was damaged. He hadn’t been married for more than a day and there I was, ordering him to his death. One person for countless others. It’s my job to do it. Still makes you feel guilty. 

Never used to make me feel guilty. 

Parsons died – and subsequently came back to life. I’m still not entirely sure how. I… Still need to speak to the two of them about it, actually. The two Parsons. I just… Need to make sure that they’re alright. That they’re coping. I should have gotten around to it earlier. I’d use catching up on work as an excuse but it’s a poor one. I’ve… Been putting it off. It goes down to that personality thing again, the wanting to rewrite who you are. Have I ever been personable? No. I’m a CO who barks out orders and sets people in line – I think it’s why I never made a good XO and clashed with the Captain all the time. Things had to be my way or no way, and getting to know the crew didn’t matter. I… I think I saw them as pawns.&quot;</div></span>

They all signed up for this. I signed up for this too. But still… Does it not feel wrong? Does it not feel wrong that it wasn’t me down there taking the risk instead of sending some innocent Lieutenant instead? Does it not feel wrong that I stay hidden away on the bridge and order everyone around while they do the dangerous work – while they keep the ship afloat and barely get any recognition, only a commendation here and a promotion there and usually there are years in between those? 

I’m not- I’m not questioning Starfleet, am I? 

I can’t question Starfleet. Not now. The Federation declared war on the Iconian Whole. I… I can’t keep on going like this. I can’t keep being derailed like this. This is what I was talking about; the needing to be there so someone else doesn’t have to make the hard call. Or-  maybe, next time, I’ll send myself and become the hard call instead. But then that would mean they would have to go through the next one by themselves. …Dunamis would handle it fine, though. But… Derailed again. Is this even a CO log any more or is it just personal? 

This never used to be so complicated. 

So much is happening at once. It’s been almost two months since I was captured by the Iconians and yet it feels like everything is only catching up now. I understand that recovery takes time, but still… Time isn’t something we have. I just – have to be fine. 

So that’s what I’ll be, alright? Talk it into existence. No more pessimism, no more derailment, no more scrambled thoughts.  

I’ll be fine. It’ll be fine. I am fine. The ship is fine. The crew is fine. We are fine.

…Computer? 

Lock that log and archive it. I don’t want to hear it again.&quot;</div></span>

So a lot has been happening lately. I.... I&#39;m not even sure how to put it, so I guess I can just ramble.

I haven&#39;t- *hadn&#39;t*- seen Ciel in quite some time, maybe a month? And then I saw him again today and he looks somehow worse than he did before. I&#39;m worried for him. I hate seeing him like this. I&#39;ve only known him for about three months, but he was my first real friend aboard this ship and I-

Well, nevermind that. I heard some pretty tasty stuff today. Something about a Top Secret mission, so I&#39;m not gonna say anything here. I did hear, though, that there&#39;s another Denobulan onboard. I want to go visit him, just to see another Denobulan... You know, I haven&#39;t seen one since I left home.

On another note,  I had a pretty stressfull weekend. The klingon party went off without a hitch, uuuuntil it did. Get a hitch, I Mean. Some dumby brought a volleyball with them and knocked out an officer of the Klingon ship. Frazzled the heck out of me. 

OH OH OH that reminds me!!! I saw the captain!!! She&#39;s okay!! She has a new voice and stuff, and I am so so so happy for her. *She even let me hug her!!!!* Truly, she is the best captain.

I have loads more to say, but I also have a great new book that I&#39;ve started reading lately called Eragon, it&#39;s an old Earth book about real dragons and dragon riders and stuff. Gronk, my birded dragon, really enjoys hearing about dragons with wings. 

Henry is doing well, so is Ru&#39;Pol and the others.

Stardate: supplementary
It&#39;s been awhile since I made one of these. I have been so consumed by my work and personal life I haven&#39;t taken the time. So much has happened in my first few months of being in Starfleet. I have participated in the first contact of four different species, experienced so much death, and yet I still feel like my career isn&#39;t having any impact in the galaxy. Maybe it&#39;s selfish of me to want some kind of recognition, that my work is helping in someway. I just don&#39;t want it all to be for nothing, you know? Though lately that has been the least of my concerns. 

Starfleet has declared war on the Iconians and being an anthropologist doesn&#39;t contribute much to the war effort other then a detailed report on the Iconians. I requested Bridge training but I haven&#39;t heard back about that yet. In the meantime, I have started shadowing Lieutenant Commander T&#39;Svai. It felt good to do something useful in the ship and not be at my little desk twiddling my thumbs. It was nice to learn about another department too. There is alot we take for granted around here. It was refreshing to get to basically switch departments for a day, though I wouldn&#39;t trade in my science blue uniform for the world. Though I wish these new uniforms weren&#39;t so *tight* in the top. I should grow accustomed to it in time though. It probably just needs to be broken in abit? </div></span>

We won&#39;t be able to see each other as often with all of this going on but we are going to try and at least eat together once a week. I can&#39;t help but worry about how everything if going to affect him. I know he has felt with tough situations before, but I can&#39;t help but help it. I&#39;m just glad the Captain is feeling better and has returned to duty. I have seen how strong she could be at Amy&#39;s wedding and I think all the commanding officers including him are glad to have a capable Captain to take the brunt of the burden of leadership. Leadership in itself is difficult in a wartime state. They will have to make hard decisions in the days ahead 

I hope Dad is okay. We haven&#39;t talked since Christmas. He will be in the middle of this war to and I can only hope that he will be safe and okay. I have always been bad about keeping in touch. Dad is the same, I must have picked it up from him. With all this going on, it makes me wish I would have talked to my parents more. I haven&#39;t talked to mom since our fight at my graduation. Maybe it&#39;s time I try and reconcile our differences. I know she hates this life I have chosen. She had made it clear since I was young. However she is still my mom and I guess... I guess I don&#39;t want this bitterness between us to continue. I don&#39;t even know how to approach her... I&#39;ll... Figure something out.</div></span>

[Stardate: 155073.63.]
Hello? I-is it working? *You can hear her tapping some of the buttons and double checking* Oh, there it goes. Hi, my name is Trephta and I am an Ensign on the USS Phoenix, medical field specializing in pathology. *She cleared her throat* Today was... Interesting to say the least. I-i just started today and already I have a very good feeling about the crew and just, well, everything in general. I made my very first friend early on and her name is Cas, she&#39;s from the science team and she started here about a month ago. Boy... I hope that I get to see her more often, she&#39;s fun to be around e-even though I only just met her. I met another, well actually two other Denobulans but the make is very, very sick. Miss Blanche, my commander, says that he might not wake up due to what happened in the medbay but I refuse to think that he won&#39;t regain consciousness! I-i mean, how can I just sit around and wait to see whether he wakes up or not without trying *something*? I want to believe that part of him is still in there and awake and listening and even though he might not be able to hear me I still want to try. He isn&#39;t bad, but then again I don&#39;t know why he was in the brig when the call for medical came over our comms, but i just... I&#39;ve always looked for the good in people and watched it come out in even the most grumpiest of people. I want to be the person that my mother wants me to be, to have the experiences that no other Denobulan have had on a ship like this.</div></span>

No. Matter. What. What else? Oh! The other Denobulan girl! She asked me if I wanted to join her for lunch and I said yes, she seems like the best person to ask about the male Denobulan. W-we don&#39;t know what caused his brain to either hemmorage or... I-it basically started to collapse in on itself... L-like it was melting from the inside. That&#39;s going to end up giving me nightmares. I intubated him and  Drake did chest compressions and eventually his vitals stabilized and we got a pulse back which I&#39;m very happy about. I&#39;m hopeful that he will wake up, like I&#39;ve already said, and only time will tell if he opens his eyes. For now he&#39;s resting comfortably and maybe he&#39;s dreaming about something happy. I don&#39;t know. I plan on telling him about what&#39;s been happening back home, giving him all the gossip that can only come from someone that has a family as large as I do. Almost thirty brothers and sisters and they&#39;re all a handful and a half but our mothers manage. Banding together to bring all of us kids up.

*She sighed sadly.* And dad? I-if you get this transmission, somehow, I just want to say that I love you and that I&#39;m taking your advice. I&#39;m giving it my all and I want to make a difference. You always said that I was smart and so... Here I am proving it. I love you and mom, tell Ellel and Arielle that I say hi and a happy marriage to Faro and his second wife. May they have many children and I&#39;m sorry that I can&#39;t be there for the reception.

Stardate: 15573.

Oh gosh, here we go. Ok computer, I guess I should just start with this, today was my first day shadowing commander Dunamis and I have to say that it wasn’t what I thought it would be. Don’t get me wrong it wasn’t bad or anything, it just wasn’t what I expected. He took me all around the ship today, talking to people about how they’re coping with their work and the war, but after the 3rd person it was clear that I’d be listening to the same thing over and over. Everyone’s nervous and everyone’s over worked. I think I could speak for all the crew now if I said that the answer to “Do you have a good sleep schedule” is either a solid no or an unsure maybe. Even then, it sounds like the only thing everyone is doing is working, eating while worrying about work, or trying to sleep while being worried about work. It really didn’t take talking to 21 people (yes I counted) to figure out that the crew is stressed. </div></span>

He’s not a bad guy or a bad first officer, but he’s a little socially inept. When I met him first in his ready room he said the weirdest thing, he told me about the plan for today, a little unexciting but ok, but then he says this: “There’s one place on the ship where we might find a lot of the crew. Do you know where?&quot; Computer it felt like I was in a child’s holodeck program and I was *mortified*. I know he didn’t mean to make me feel that way, and he’s probably never been in a situation like this but seriously? Like, I know I’m not the youngest person he’s worked with, he used to be the CTO, and I really know that it’s not because he’s not used to talking to people my age, considering he’s dating someone younger than me, so it just really confuses me. And, computer, don’t get me wrong here I’m not angry or anything, I’m just honestly baffled. I knew his job wasn’t the most exciting of them all and to be honest I knew he wasn’t the most social person, but I’m still confused and frustrated! I hope things improve over the next few weeks, if they don&#39;t go well I’m not sure how much I’ll get out of the experience.</div></span>

Stardate 155073.9

I’ve been very much neglecting these logs, you’d think serving almost 6 years on a starship would correct that, however quite the opposite has occurred. 

Anyway, I’m starting to feel more involved with the crew of the Phoenix. This project with Commander Higgins is going very well, and while I admit I may have stolen the majority of the work on the project, it has proven to be quite the stress reliever. The Commander and I have tested the majority of the major systems, and while a major adjustment to the dimensions of the craft still needs to be made the combat effectiveness of the shuttle has been outstanding, as was its speed and maneuverability, though after the changes to the dimensions might effect speed and handling, it will be a negligible loss in both aspects. 

The weapons systems of this system caught the eye of our resident torpedo expert, and he agreed to help me bring the admittedly rather dated designs to the 25th century, which will improve their effectiveness by a considerable margin. 

This brings me to another development: one of the micro-torpedo variants, a gravimetric version, particularly caught Mister Tan’s eye. As it would seem, Tactical has been brainstorming a way to develop defenses against the Iconians for our next encounter, should we be attacked again. As well as updating my own designs, I’ve been working on upscaling the gravimetric variants to a full scale torpedo and make it safe to carry. It’s... difficult to say the least, especially since my speciality is in warp core dynamics and warp theory rather than tactical systems and torpedo engineering. I’m learning as I’m going, though, and it seems to be going well. Perhaps I should consider a career change...

Ensign Nedras, Tactical
Stardate: 155084.45

<div class="pre pre--multiline nohighlight">I meant to do these more often. It&#39;s been busy lately. I&#39;ve slept for twelve hours in the past six days and that&#39;s not ideal even without a Klingon-battle-simulation-slash-interrogation - I&#39;m getting ahead of myself. Whose idea was it to make these verbal?

Warhead tests went according to plan. It was exhilarating. Even working on the report feels momentous, and I&#39;m not even responsible for the weaponry involved. I should tell my friends. Cas especially. I&#39;ll do that after I&#39;ve actually written the report. Priorities. But it worked!

The ACTO and CEO said I&#39;ve been helpful simply because I did my job. I can&#39;t recall anyone saying that about Nedras 1 or 2. It wasn&#39;t followed by a demand for more work either, so I don&#39;t know what to do with that. I think I&#39;m happy? No, I&#39;m sure I&#39;m happy.

As I speculated in my last log, it&#39;s getting more exciting to be aboard now that we&#39;ve departed spacedock. As I did not speculate in my last log, war has been declared against the Iconian Whole. I&#39;ve started additional training. I&#39;ve been getting to know my crewmates. They&#39;re extremely competent and inventive.  I&#39;m glad to be fighting alongside them and not opposite. Then again, with the Dominion being marked as potentially hostile in the diplomatic dossier, who knows? Maybe one day I&#39;ll face someone with a face like mine in battle and come to regret my choice of ally. For now, though, it&#39;s a good change. As was the case at the Academy, nobody seems to mind or even notice that I&#39;m not an ideal Vorta.

One doubt remains. The other day, after an exhausting battle simulation, a friend of mine started asking me about my past, hinting I&#39;d lied to them, asking what kind of failure means death to me. I was terrified. The other party mistook a defensive gesture for something more final. It almost ended badly. For a moment I thought... that&#39;s not important. Computer, end log.</div></span>

I have spoken with Ensign Nedras several times since I made my last log of this nature. He seems to be doing rather well for himself. Though I am quite happy to see Nedras working hard and succeeding, our most recent interaction has me very worried. 

I had invited him to join me in a play through of my Battle of Nihcor holoprogram. This is a training program meant to help keep a blademasters’ skills sharp during peacetime. It is a Klingon program. Nedras proved himself an excellent bladesman with the kar’takin. That is a sort of single-edged battleaxe with a stabbing tip used by Jem’Hadar for close-quarters combat. He is also very creative when it comes to tactics. It was after the near-completion of the second part of the holoprogram that the incident occurred.
 
Although I consider him a friend, our relationship has been a bit precarious. I am often too direct with my opinions. It shows when we speak of topics he is sensitive about, such as the Dominion and the Founders. He has expressed the rather harsh viewpoint that ‘failure is death.’ I was curious to know exactly how far that was meant to be taken. I used the hypothetical: if one is caught in a web of lies he has spun to endear himself to others, did that small failure mean death? Since our first meeting, Nedras had lied to myself and others about a variety of topics. I took them as his attempt to endear himself to us. After all, he is a Vorta in Starfleet. He must be having great difficulty adjusting. I meant nothing more than curiosity by the question. Despite that, it was phrased somewhat hostilly.</div></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace"><div class="pre pre--multiline nohighlight">Nedras percieved it as a threat, and a dire one, at that. He placed his hand on his chin, dangerously close to the trigger for the termination chips implanted in all Vorta. He asked me why I had used such a specific example, and I did not answer him straight. I was focused on where he had chosen to place his hand. I removed his hand from the danger area by force and restrained him. It was an instinctive action. I was frightened that he might attempt to activate it. He, reasonably, took my actions as hostile, and asked me if I intended to arrest him, and if Security was involved. I did explain myself after that, and we ended on somewhat friendly terms.
 
I do not expect to speak with Nedras again for a long time. I betrayed his trust. It is only natural that he would want to avoid me. I won’t intrude upon that.
 
This whole incident has been upsetting. Firstly, in that I have hurt a friend. Secondly, in that the hurt has revealed something a little disturbing about Nedras. I believe he is withholding a very big secret. Something that may get him in trouble with Starfleet, if it were ever to be revealed. 
My reasoning is this: When we first met, he told me that he had left the Dominion for fear of death. He was afraid that if he continued down their path, he would be killed. I am convinced that he was lying about this. That is confirmed by the fact that he was willing to activate his termination chip had I unraveled his deception. Why should a man who, by all accounts, is terrified to die even dream of activating that chip? The only logical answer is that he is hiding something enormously important that iIt has him worried about Security. I am genuinely afraid for him. Suppose someone calls him out as I have, and he does activate that chip?
 
In other news, I may need to take a refresher course on deescalation. I’ve been around Klingons for too long. They’ve rubbed off on me.</div></span>

I have completed orientation and about to begin my first shift in approximately two hours, which would be delta shift. I had visited the bridge and met Lieutenant Junior Grade Howard, who shall work with me in case of emergency. We have agreed to begin a friendly relationship designed to improve relations between ourselves for ideal working conditions in case of such emergency.

Socialization with the ship&#39;s crew is satisfactory, acquisition of a base of friendship is nominal. I expect no resistance in acclimation. A supplemental log is to be expected at the end of delta shift. 

End log.</div></span>

Stardate…..oh who cares

I&#39;ve never done one of these before, and I guess there&#39;s no time like the present to try one. Honestly I don&#39;t know what to say here, I&#39;ve never even kept a diary before! But that was for different reasons….Guess it comes with having a terrible brother hellbent on destroying you.

I had to spend a few days in sickbay with…..I don&#39;t know what it was but it made my brain short circuit. It was the cherry on top of a very unwanted cake that has been the last few weeks. You know how they say a mental break isn&#39;t sudden? That it&#39;s gradual and the break is usually caused by something minor? I know it&#39;s silly but…..I feel like I&#39;m edging towards it, every day just a little closer and I don&#39;t know how to draw back from it.

The funny part is that up until a few weeks ago, I was completely fine. And then the away mission happened….and now I feel like I&#39;m spiraling towards something I won&#39;t be able to escape easily. That right there triggered something and--Computer, pause log.</div>&#160;

<div class="pre pre--multiline nohighlight">Computer, resume recording. Anyway, since then it seemed like things have just snowballed. Not that whatever was triggered by finding Kennox isn&#39;t minor but….being &quot;killed&quot; by Noi triggered something too. Something….deeper that I&#39;ve kept locked up and buried for a very long time.

Except now I can&#39;t stop thinking about it. It&#39;s been dragged right to the surface and so have other memories I&#39;m not ready to…to…t--I&#39;m sorry, I cant--I can&#39;t breathe.</div>

<div class="pre pre--multiline nohighlight">I’ll begin this by saying it’s been too long. A lot… a lot has happened over the last few months. People are… gone. Tessk is gone. Kytha is gone. Others. Commander T’Svai is the first officer now. And it&#39;s not- it&#39;s not that I don’t like change, it’s just… a lot. To handle, I mean. To think about.
I’ve had to wear an EV suit twice in two weeks, which is two times more than I would’ve liked, for reasons I wasn’t necessarily expecting. 
The first reason is a lot more painful than the second. I don’t like to think about the crew- my friends, Ramat- sick and in pain. It just makes me hurt to think about how all I could do was give them medication and hope for the best. I mean, it all worked out, but what if it hadn’t? And I’m not even right, it didn’t work out, because someone died. Lieutenant Parsons died, who I never even met- she- she died.
[A long pause, then a sigh.]
I just pulled an almost two day long shift in an EV suit, which is actually really uncomfortable when you wear it for more than a few hours. I watched baby ice rats eat each other. And on top of all that, I’m worried about Nedras.
Prophets, I’m- [something thumps] I’m always worried about Nedras recently. Our relationship is so strange, like I’m constantly teetering between whether he likes me or never wants to see me again. I consider him one of my close friends, but I also feel like I don’t know anything about him. He’s been more and more… off lately, and I have been pushing him about it, just to get him to talk to me, but I know he’s not used to that kind of thing. He kept saying something about “not being defective” and I can’t… why would he think that?</div></span>

Do we make him think he’s replaceable? Is that just lingering Founder mind garbage? If Ramat can understand that he’s his own person, why can’t Nedras? I know Joe and I try and tell him all the time, but I just… he’s a good friend. A good person. 
I can’t imagine what he had to do in that stupid rat nest. Or what kind of memories it brought up. I told him- I suggested that he go to therapy and he’s going. I think. And I hope it’s good for him. 
Because maybe it’s a little selfish- maybe I’m being selfish, and self-serving, and everything else- but… I don’t want to lose him too.

<div class="quote">Amy’s been gone for a few weeks, and already the void in sickbay is palpable. The whole crew is mourning, and Malcolm is taking this as well as can be expected. Trying an old Vulcan trick to keep myself from breaking down on my shift, even though I didn’t know her well in life. 

The air on the ship is heavy, though the climate control panel insists that the air pressure is still 760mmHg, which is the same as Earth sea level. I miss Kianaa most during times like this, and I wonder if she thinks about me as much as I think of her, and it reminds me just how quickly life can change— or end —and we’d never know. I think I’ll head down to the gym and hit the bag a few times, been a while since I’ve taken my mind off work or life and just relaxed a bit.

<div class="quote">Tomorrow is the day, the day I have dreaded for a long time now. A day that will celebrate Amy, the woman that I love and yet I will be sad for it is one thing to celebrate with her and another too do so without her. She would want me to be happy though, I fear such feelings I haven&#39;t felt often after her passing. She one of the first people I met on the ship. Together we were exploring the galaxy as we each gained experience we each seemed to grow as a team and in our love for each other. I do not think we were made to live forever even if me and Amy lived to the end of time it would not have been enough time. Though I feel we all must pass on though we &quot;don&#39;t know for whom the bell tolls&quot; I find comfort in that I have had the experinse Amy had I know what it is like to die it wasn&#39;t scary, well it was a little but, I knew I was dying for a crew that deserved my life because they were incredible people and that by me losing my own life I was able to save others. Though I&#39;m not sure Amy had the sense of giving ones life for others, I hope that at the end she could justify all the moments that we laughed and cried together and in the end I hoped she lived a good life and I hope I helped to enrich her life as much as she did mine. My last thoughts were of Amy though I may never know what she thought of I hope it was something meaningful. Lord knows I thought about the person with the largest impact on my life. I just miss her so much...

Personal log, stardate... I detest this system. There&#39;s something to be said for its precision, but only at the expense of clear temporal landmarks and any semblance of multi-millennial- anyway. Where was I?

I&#39;m alone for the first time in my life, and it&#39;s my fault. Part of me wishes I&#39;d simply had the good sense to listen to the Founder&#39;s words. Defective Vorta are often unaware of the full scope of their defects, and it is indeed possible that I&#39;d have been better served by termination than by a short, temporary life here.

At minimum I can now say I&#39;ve negotiated with a Founder, a feat I&#39;m sure few Vorta would dare attempt. One might say it&#39;s like negotiating with the wind, or an earthquake, except somehow I made such motion cease despite its impossibility. There will, evidently, be no obvious diplomatic repercussions. All for the mere price of being labeled a traitor.

Few words have ever hurt more than traitor. I have been nothing but loyal, defective or otherwise. Until after our discussion I levied no insults, never sought to stray from the path I was given. Even my predecessor, for all his alleged hemming and hawing and moping, could hardly be swayed to such a thing. I haven&#39;t done anything against the Founder or the Dominion other than demand the right to live. I didn&#39;t need to make that report, I-

It is too much for any Vorta to hope that one day the Founders will answer to them, but I hold that hope within me now. I am owed that. 

Until such a time comes, I&#39;m free. And I&#39;m Starfleet. That&#39;s all that matters.

I just hope the Founder doesn&#39;t change her mind.
