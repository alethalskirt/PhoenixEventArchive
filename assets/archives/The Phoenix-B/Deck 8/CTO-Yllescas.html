The typical federation grey carpet had a red rug thrown over it. Near the replicator, an actual kitchen had been set up. Varis enjoyed cooking a real meal from time to time it seemed. There was a shelf between the living and dining space that held a selection of a few real-alcohol beverages. A few tequila&#39;s and, in the back, tucked away, Romulan Ale. In the living space itself, there was a board game spread across the coffee table, set up to be played against the computer. There was also a selection of to-paper-printed books spread out over the plush sofa, which had a knit throw blanket over it as well. On the ledge near the viewport into the stars, was a small collection of photographs. There was one of Varis and a woman that looked remarkably like her, but was older, but not elderly by any means. Another was of a little girl who did look like Varis in miniature, and a dark haired, Romulan man. They were smiling. There were a few other pictures of the other woman, but this was the only one of the man. There was a photograph of Varis, likely only a few years old and  another group of young Romulans, clearly taken on New Romulus. The final picture, was of Varis and a young Romulan man, both smiling. Several candles were always lit throughout the main living space of the Quarters. Several pieces of art hung throughout as did several trinkets, sitting around.

There was a stuffed Targ set on the bedside table, and several incense burners in the room. In the Bathroom, there was an array of nice toiletries brought aboard. Clearly, Varis valued her quarters as her space to escape and to express herself.</div></span>

&quot;That will not be necessary, sir.&quot; <em>Maleb said as he moved to a nearby chair, waiting behind it with his hands placed squarely on the back of the chair for a beat before sitting down directly across from the Commander.

She died, one week before they found a medication to treat her illness.

&quot;I&#39;m glad they supported you because you&#39;re a fine officer, and you&#39;re damn good at your job from what I&#39;ve seen.&quot; <em>When he talked about hobbies though...</em> &quot;Well Maleb, it&#39;s time that we changed that. Everyone needs a hobby or...something outside of work. Even if it&#39;s meditation or a hot bath or...reading a book. You need something that isn&#39;t work because right now you look like you&#39;re going to pull a muscle just by moving in the wrong direction. You need to learn how to relax.&quot; <em>She set the cup down finally.</em> &quot;I&#39;ve heard about CTATS, it&#39;s impressive. I intend to put it to use soon.&quot; <em>She leaned forward and cut the pie, serving him a piece first before grabbing a piece for herself.</em> &quot;Have at it.&quot; <em>She pointed to the dessert as she herself, dug in.</em></span>

The smell of the alcohol carried enough to combine with the scent of the dessert, the sharpness contrasted against the sweet. After a pause, he &#39;dug in&#39; as well - though he wouldn&#39;t have described it that way, seeing as he didn&#39;t know the phrase or what it meant.</em>

&quot;Thank you, sir. If you have any issues with CTATS, at any time, or require the implementation of a new feature, I can certainly add it, sir, although the range of tags already present can handle most needs.&quot;

<em>Maleb looked up at Varis after a moment, realizing she thought he didn&#39;t do <strong>anything</strong> outside of work. He was a Vulcan; of course he did the logical amount to care for himself, on top of what was necessitated by his abilities.</em>
&quot;I believe I gave you the wrong impression, sir. I should have clarified: I do indeed meditate and read. I am Vulcan, and meditation is considered vital to my people, and I consume a great deal of literature about weaponry, diplomacy, and Tactical matters, sir.&quot;

<em>Pausing for a moment, the man considered her words about the Tal Shiar. With what he had seen, and what he had heard and inferred, the Tal Shiar were positively brutal. That she had seen her father killed by them and then gone on to serve with them... It must have taken more strength than he could comprehend.</em>

&quot;I do not use the word evil lightly, sir, but I can easily apply it to the Tal Shiar. They are evil. Not the individuals, of course, individuals have their own needs and can be taken advantage of. But the organization that takes advantage of them <strong>is</strong>.&quot;</span>

They&#39;re made with fruit and sugar and a bready crust. They&#39;re quite good. Growing up on Vulcan I&#39;ve always been adventurous with food, given my childhood foods were always rather...bland, at least those outside of the Romulan dishes we managed to get.&quot;

&quot;I will. I think it&#39;ll be a boon to departmental training.&quot; <em>She gave him a quick nod and a matching smile.</em> &quot;There is a simulation I&#39;ll be running that doesn&#39;t have it, but that&#39;s just because I want it to be a surprise for <em>you</em> as well. After that, your program will be department standard for all scenarios.&quot;

&quot;Tactical matters. Weapons. Diplomacy. I meant...you need to read for fun. Read something about...an adventure or...something. Or find a hobby that is <em>fun</em> come on there has to be <em>some</em> part of you that desires <em>fun</em>.&quot; <em>She looked absolutely incredulous.</em> &quot;You meditate and read books about the topic in which you work in. That...isn&#39;t what I meant at all.&quot; <em>She actually had a little laugh, almost a giggle.</em>

&quot;The Tal Shiar <em>are</em> evil. I came out of the intelligence academy and was offered a position, and I thought it was an honor. I thought it was a way for me to serve the Romulan people in a way that few can. &quot; <em>She shook her head though, and her eyes seemed...almost glazed over. She said nothing more. The pit in her stomach was solid. She stood by the actions she had taken in service to them, it didn&#39;t mean that those actions didn&#39;t haunt her. So, she turned her attention to her pie, which she quickly finished off.</em></span>

It is similar to the tarts that Commander Dunamis made for the, department some time ago, sir, although the crust is different. I grew up on Vulcan as well.&quot; <em>-though he hadn&#39;t been born there.</em> &quot;I believe that I can understand somewhat what you mean by bland, sir. Compared to Vulcan cuisine, this is a fascinating food. I did not have the opportunity to eat non-Vulcan dishes, growing u, sir, but my fellow officers, especially Lieutenant Sara Bj&#248;rge, have introduced me to other cultures and their traditional foods, sir.&quot;

&quot;The department is already quite familiar with CTATS, and I can assist you in familiarizing yourself with its use, sir. I do ask to be present when the program&#39;s settings are inputted, because some of the variables can alter the safeties, sir, and the warning very occasionally fails. I believe that you should be warned that the department&#39;s last training session had... an unfortunate conclusion. They may be unsure of themselves -- or they may be fine. I am not sure, sir.&quot; <em>He looked back down at his food solemnly, putting his fork down for a moment, remembering what had happened. She didn&#39;t need to know specifics... But the department had been affected. But that was only for a second, his hesitance only lingering for a few beats before he picked his fork back up and continued eating in small, polite bites.</em>

&quot;I do not see the logic in reading fiction, sir. It is far more efficient to read books that will benefit the crew and the ship. I also assist occasionally in the arboretum, sir.&quot; <em>He raised an eyebrow at her unbelieving look, and appeared to be somewhat confused by her laugh, but he decided not to ask, seeing as the topic shifted quickly to the Tal Shiar.</em></span>

Given your dietary choices though.&quot; <em>She motioned to the sweeter option.</em> &quot;If you&#39;re ever looking for something to try, though it may not fit your preference, try a Romulan Mollusk. You can only replicate them, really. Only a few farms exist anymore, since the Nova.&quot; <em>her face sort of fell at that but that was just a simple fact of life.

&quot;I appreciate the heads up. I&#39;ll keep that in mind.&quot; <em>She certainly took mental note to not just go wild with setting programs up, lest she have a department half beaten or shot to death.</em> &quot;They will be fine. Failure is a simple part of life. Being unsure of ones self in our line of work though, is something we must push past. It is part of your duty as ACTO to  help them push past that. That means that you must cheer them on, or be hard on them. Sometimes, both at the same time. It&#39;s a balancing act. I expect greatness out of all of you, and I know for a fact that you are all capable of it.&quot;

&quot;Not everything you do needs to have logic behind it. You might understand some of your counterparts a bit better, myself included if you too accepted that. Though...being raised with Vulcans I understand that&#39;s rather difficult.&quot; <em>She got to her feet and went to her sofa, picking up a book. It was a classic novel, not too long but not too short. It was Romulan. It was about an Agent of the Empire working to protect her goals, falling in his duty to do so, but succeeding in his mission. It contained Violence, and plot, and romance. It was everything a good novel should be. It was a classic. Best of all, it was laced with Romulan secrecy and subterfuge, with a hint of tactics. &quot;Here.&quot; *She set it on the table</em> &quot;Don&#39;t apologize.

Please come back to me on a date and time on which you will be available soonest. Please don&#39;t misunderstand the implications and tone of this meeting; the agenda of it is to simply to get to know you.</div></span>

I apologise for the time it’s taken for me to get back to, I’ve been exceptionally busy adjusting to and running the Tactical department, the first few days are always quite a run.

Each one placed you in the main player position and offered the viewpoint of the ship or car; already making the games harder but there were also three settings for speed/difficulty. There was also the option for hooking it up to a holodeck or inputting simulations of flying a ship like the Phoenix through many different scenarios based on these games.</em> 

<em>There was also a simplistic card with a classic Santa image on the front. The inside was hand written and stated:</em> 

<em>&#39;Hello,</em> 
<em>I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve had the pleasure to meet you before. But I was hoping perhaps that these games that are tried and true with the human population might be a fun diversion when off duty. I tried to take into consideration your interests based on your position in the ship. Enjoy!</em>

</div>&gt; 
<div class="quote">I would like to hold a senior staff meeting in the <span class="mention">#conference-room</span> in two days&#39; time. As you all know there is a possible war ahead of us; I would like for us to be prepared as possible. Please come prepared with the information laid out below: -
</div>&gt; 
<div class="quote"><strong>Tactical and Security</strong> 
Please advise on our combat readiness. Commander Arosio, as per our correspondence, please come prepared with details as to the shipwide combat training. If need be, work with lieutenant Parlac. 
</div>&gt; 
<div class="quote"><strong>Engineering and Operations</strong> 
Please advise on the integrity of our systems and operations; if need be please reinforce the same and keep me advised of progress. 
</div>&gt; 
<div class="quote"><strong>Medical</strong> 
Please advise if our medical supplies need to be replenished and of any further such needs. I sense that we will need them desparately in the days ahead, more so than ever before. 
</div>&gt; 
<div class="quote"><strong>Science</strong> 
Please come prepared with information on Iconian culture and their military history. Perhaps it may be of use to us in finding a diplomatic solution - however impossible that might be - or in finding a weakness if it comes to that. This time I sense that merely returning the World Heart will not be enough to quell this conflict. 
</div>&gt; 
<div class="quote">I commend you all for your bravery thus far. I am pleased to see that despite these trying times we remain steadfast in our operations and mindset. Help me to maintain this. Please. We cannot have the crew in chaos ahead of such a monumental battle and you all know that. 
</div>&gt; 
<div class="quote">I hope to see you all there. Stay safe, friends.

<div class="quote">Efforts are underway to prepare the ship for further combat against the Iconians. The ship’s housing of civilians has been drawn to my attention. In order to preserve civilian lives, it may be prudent for the ship to undertake saucer separation. With the regular bridge crew moving to the battle bridge, it means that another crew is required to lead the saucer section – housing evacuated civilians – to safety. 
</div>&gt; 
<div class="quote">A designated bridge crew for the separation has now been created. You have been assigned as the saucer section’s designated commanding officer. Full information on all full postings to the vessel shall be made available shortly.

He wished his own parents were here, mostly to offer some advice on what he should do. Maybe one of his siblings could help with this kind of thing. Maybe someone onboard knew about children as well?

<div class="quote">To: Senior Staff, USS Phoenix
From: Commander T&#39;Svai
</div>&gt; 
<div class="quote">The events of the past two weeks have been harrowing for all those involved. I believe they only highlight the importance of strong, unified leadership in crisis, but perhaps more vitally, the importance of spending time with others in the quiet moments between such occasions.
</div>&gt; 
<div class="quote">As such, I wish to reschedule the senior staff dinner for tonight, at the start of Delta shift. It remains optional. There is no dress code.
</div>&gt; 
<div class="quote">Sincerely,
Commander T&#39;Svai</div></span>

The gym was probably full of officers by now, and he guessed the holodecks were about to be swarmed by enlisted looking for a break. The pool seemed like the best option. Plus, he hadn’t actually been to one on a starship before, so it would count as a new experience.
