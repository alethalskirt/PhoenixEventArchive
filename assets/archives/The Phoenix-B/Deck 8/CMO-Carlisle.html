<div class="quote">Hi Commander,
</div>&gt; 
<div class="quote">I don&#39;t wish to intrude unto your shore leave time, I just wondered if you would have time for a talk? It can wait until shore leave is done without problems, though it might be preferable before we get another mission, as it might involved a, huh, possible transfer.
Reading myself back, I feel the format sounds rather professional, but it&#39;s more, huh, personal-related, hence why I didn&#39;t send it to your office... also, I wasn&#39;t sure of its state yet or if you&#39;d visit it sooner or later...

Not only had the Turkish Angora declined to exhibit any gratitude for the godforsaken food, she had declined to take any interest in it whatsoever. Supposing it was probably not gourmet enough for her standards, Carlisle was far too harrowed by the entire ordeal to be properly upset about it; disheartening as it was, there were more important things at hand.</em>

<em>The message, for one. Had it been light-hearted, the doctor might have been able to find amusement in the initial portion of her day. Meeting Amanda had been lovely, and the irony that had followed <strong>was</strong> so typical that she might as well laugh, but Blanche couldn&#39;t. If the woes of cat lady business wasn&#39;t all too much for the woman&#39;s nerve, this was. Thus, absent of the mirth she&#39;d much rather be the bearer of, the CMO settled down at her desk in order to type up a response.</em></span>

Of course, to no surprise, nothing came of her doing so. Nothing coherent, at least. For somebody so scatterbrained, such an influx in conflicting emotion wasn&#39;t exactly the easiest to navigate. Blanche&#39;s thoughts were clouded to a frustrating degree, although her expression softened as she looked upon the young officer. Beforehand, her overwhelming shame had not allowed Carlisle the latitude to look beyond the implications on a personal level. Not that any of this was <strong>impersonal</strong>, far from it. Watching Newton, though, she had been forced to regard the bigger, nauseatingly surreal picture. What the hell was this like for <strong>him?</strong> It was this question that brought outright guilt to the forefront of Blanche&#39;s mind, that of which did nothing to diminish the ridiculous feeling that her own quarters were closing in on her. Delicate features were contorted slightly, furrowed into a look of equal helplessness and remorse. Blue eyes studied their counterpart, equally as blue; a jarring validation of the nurse&#39;s words that had been so trying to process. She had finally come face to face with the past she had thought herself detached from entirely.</em> 

&quot;The Hill family, 2454. Atlanta, Georgia.&quot; <em>Again, her words were exceedingly mellow, slow, and paired with the smallest, most wistful of smiles upon scarlet lips. Still, there was still that slight inclination of Blanche&#39;s head to one side, and she still had arms wrapped about her middle. The doctor&#39;s gaze was observatory now, not scrutinous. Her racing thoughts had been alleviated to a dull hum, not dissimilar to the newly numb sensation she felt overall.</em> &quot;You were a tiny little thing, and awful quiet. I met your mothers briefly, and I just—.&quot; <em>To her own dismay, Blanche&#39;s voice hitched in her throat.</em> &quot;I knew they&#39;d be able to take real good care of you.&quot; <em>One look at the young man before her was confirmation enough that they had.</em></span>

Of course, that was far from the case; the notion of a transfer was merely a contrivance, an easy way for both parties to avoid the awkwardness that came with their newfound circumstances. Both were medically trained, and albeit to differing degrees, both Newton <strong>and</strong> Blanche were well aware that symptom management could only do so much. The cause would eventually have to be addressed, and thus, their distancing would have no benefit at all — the connection was there nonetheless, and was there for good.

Grief internalised, and locked away in a little box at the far corners of her mind to remain there in eternity. Of course, this was also unfair, both to the man in question, herself, and their son. His son, who of course, would make such an enquiry. Blanche felt burdened, revolted even by her hesitation at first, but rationality took hold and reminded her that it was a reaction to be expected. It appeared as though Newton had come to a similar conclusion, for his own trepidation was hardly inconspicuous. Following the miniature revelation, Blanche found that the resulting silence had become desolate; utilising a soft hum to combat it, blue eyes adopted a wistfulness that regarded the young man stood before her in a new light.</em></span>

&quot;His name was Thomas, and he was the kindest, most compassionate person I&#39;ve ever known.&quot; <em>In this instance, the woman&#39;s tone was all but freed of its prior rigidity, lilted with a fondness so vivid it were as though he was present in the room with them. Perhaps, in some spiritual means she&#39;d never quite subscribed to herself, he was. In Newton, she began to perceive each and every quirk that she had failed to before, feeling equal parts bereft and enlightened. Accordingly, Blanche&#39;s smile mellowed, and she was all but restored to her previous composure with only the fewest of fissures. The looming threat of tears, most glaringly, that she was quick to dismiss with delicate motions. Furthermore, the doctor shook her head in gentle restraint; this was not to become some pity party, but the best recollection she was able to give for the boy who so deserved it.</em> 

&quot;First officer, always runnin&#39; headfirst into danger. You would&#39;ve scolded him like I did, and he would&#39;ve loved you for it. Oh, he would&#39;ve just loved you more than anythin&#39;, havin&#39; his own son.&quot; <em>The latter, surely, had been a task left for Blanche to fulfil. One at which she had failed miserably, and backed out of in, what, self-preservation? Only briefly did her guilt resurface, brows furrowing gently. As before, it became necessary that she allow room for rationale, however selfish, and that melancholy phantom of a smile soon returned to Carlisle&#39;s features</em>. &quot;You were born just after he died, and I . . &quot; <em>Subconsciously, lithe shoulders were brought up into a slow, hapless shrug, the doctor still seemingly unable to untangle arms from about her middle. Blanche felt vulnerable enough as it was, dependent on that compassion she now knew to be intrinsic to allow her some lenience. Upon its admission, twenty-something years later, the woman&#39;s greatest defeat still felt like the most fresh, open of wounds.</em> &quot;I just wasn&#39;t brave enough. I couldn&#39;t do it.&quot;</span>

Well, a bit of a hyperbole, though it may or may not have held some truth. Brains do seem to &#39;slow down&#39; time, sometimes. As you&#39;re waiting for something to happen, seconds would seem like minutes, and those like hours. Was it any better than asking her to dig her husband&#39;s coffin in the cemetery, opening the case to show him his deceased father? Somewhat less gore and disturbing, again perhaps a hyperbole at use. This one was quite closer to the reality, albeit a tad less literally. Emotionally speaking though, was there much difference?</em>

<em>A hum, filling that unbearable silence... And here, she delivered all he had asked. His breath, which he hadn&#39;t even noticed he had held back, was let out, and in again, on a somewhat regular rhythm. The father had now a name, qualities, and &#39;flaws&#39;, depending on how one&#39;s view was. For Newt? Well... Would have scolded him? Totally. Like she said she and he would have done. Although, would Newt have done exactly the same if it involved other lives? Yes, also. With no hesitation. Like him, this time. Ah well, if he had been wondering if these blue, familiar yet not quite the same, eyes could see similarities, or anything, to what had once been part of this husband, father and simply Thomas... well, now he could see it too. Or partially, at least. What would he give to see himself with her eyes right now, or just see</em> <em><strong>him</strong></em> <em>in the mirror! Would he dare ask for a picture? Well... maybe not now? It was one thing to remind her of all of that, and now... It could surely wait.</em>

<em>Wasn&#39;t it funny how that now that he had focused more on her wellbeing than on how he was the one to have put her in that state, and don&#39;t you start again on that Newton, he could think more clearly, tell himself facts he had a hard time believing just for her sake. Think a little about what would actually do that &#39;transfer idea&#39;. Or would rather not do. His breathing was less erratic, too. He was a healer at heart, of the mind and the body although being more specialized in the latter, and he didn&#39;t miss the little signs, however short were they. Guilt. Obviously. Would everything be perfect, both their guilt and worries washed away instantly? Absolutely not. Would it take some adjustments? Certainly. But... he... he would wash away his worries for a second, a minute, an hour, a week... whatever it&#39;d take to help. His father would have loved him and she had loved Thomas, but he had died and she was still hurting after all this time. There was, logically, one possibility for him. One thing to do.</em>

Frightened though she still was by it all, Newt had put her at a newfound state of ease that was more than welcome. Easily, too, in the way his father had been so skilled, and to such an extent that the room around them no longer felt threatening. If anything, Blanche utilised Eirson&#39;s words as a safety blanket; courageous to the point that his own conviction in her own bravery was somewhat ironic. If she weren&#39;t such a wreck, she&#39;d commend him for the same feat. Carlisle might well have been able to, admittedly accomplished in the art of saving face. It was the following action, furthering the impact of Newton&#39;s resonant words, that soon rendered the latter an impossibility.</em> 

<em>Not quite falling to pieces just yet, the doctor was well aware that she was on the very verge of doing so nonetheless. Newton&#39;s arms were around her before she could string together a coherent response, and though the embrace resulted in her fa&#231;ade of togetherness to once more become fragile, she was grateful all the same. Quite frankly, she wasn&#39;t sure what to say — any effort to stop tears at this stage would only be in vain, although they were hardly loud or unsightly. No, the woman remained all but silent for some time, equal parts taken aback and thankful for the sudden intimacy. The hug was not reciprocated immediately, as a result, and brows furrowed yet again in that tell-tale manner of reason to be pensive. It would take time to adjust, and process things properly. She was certain Newt had acknowledged that, as bright as he was, but had simply been the more plucky of the pair in taking the first vital step.</em>

Almost gingerly, her arms wrapped about the other in an act she would have priorly engaged in without a moment&#39;s reluctance. Not with Newton, with whom she had become so fond of being around. Their rapport was one she cherished, and one that had reminded Carlisle of home from the instance they had met. How peculiar that now, he signified a proximity to the home she had so wanted it was <strong>painful</strong>, slipping cruelly through her fingers all over again. In giving her son away, Blanche had created for herself a sort of limbo where nothing <strong>had</strong> to be real, the fleeting nature of the life she had yearned for no longer needing to be addressed. It was as though now, committing to a closeness with him condemned her dream forever. A fragment of the fantasy so far displaced from it that the idea finally faded to a harshly final intangibility. Stood there motionless, the conclusion Blanche arrived at drove her to nausea. This fear of proximity stemmed from her unwillingness to <strong>accept</strong>, and it was with the realisation that this was what she would have to do in order to move forward that the doctor finally fell apart.</em>

&quot;I&#39;m so sorry,&quot; <em>was all she could manage before submitting to the manner in which she&#39;d been truly overwhelmed. The tears were certainly more pronounced, littered with sniffs and hitches in the woman&#39;s breath that indicated they had been on the brink of release for some time. It wasn&#39;t as though Newton could see her eventual resignation, mind. Blanche had pulled him close as if to let him go would only incur a repetition of this unpleasant onslaught of emotion. She really did try to rein it in, and though the attempt was to little avail initially, Blanche did manage to refrain from sobbing full out. To break down on him entirely would hardly be fair: a concept that had been of great prominence since everything had come to light.</em></span>

<em>He said it would be alright, and so it would. Optimism was something Blanche held in high esteem, and was an asset she had found to be wavering over years gone bye. One blow, and it suffered tremendously. Continuous hits, and its loss became devastating. Newton&#39;s was still very much intact, it appeared — though she strived to keep her own in a position of precedence, it seemed that it wouldn&#39;t go amiss for Blanche to take notes from none other than her son. For longer than she could remember, Carlisle had not considered the phenomenon of passing down traits in such a personal regard; she had been sure to leave herself with no reason to. Now, pulling gently away from Newton with hands reluctant to leave his shoulders, Blanche allowed herself to smile again. A soft nod signalled her reflection of his words, followed by a much firmer, certain one, obstinate in agreement.</em> &quot;No. No, my god, no more cryin&#39;! We&#39;re goin&#39; to be just fine, you and me, and I <em>won&#39;t</em> have you givin&#39; up what you&#39;ve worked so hard for.&quot; <em>Another sniff, and Blanche moved to absentmindedly smooth out the collar of his shirt she&#39;d left in quite the crumpled state.</em> I&#39;ve always told you how proud I am, Newt, but I&#39;m goin&#39; to tell you again: I couldn&#39;t be <em>prouder</em>.&quot;</span>

But if what she needed was to say it again right now, well he&#39;d let her.

It wouldn&#39;t be a lie to say he was reluctant to let go of the hug once it was time, and it, maybe (totally), hadn&#39;t only been good for her. He wouldn&#39;t show it externally though, it was only a plus if he could have also found some comfort in it, certainly not the main goal. Not that he&#39;d say it either, but the hands who lingered on his shoulders and smoothed out his collar were rather pleasant, though he wasn&#39;t sure why his mind was seeking touch right now. Far from being someone distant normally, he wasn&#39;t the most touch-craving person walking on this ship, in this universe. Maybe it was just the magic of a gentle, motherly touch? She &#39;hadn&#39;t&#39; been for long, but wasn&#39;t this something supposedly innate-? Ok-ok, maybe this was enough of this train of thought... wasn&#39;t he thinking about how it&#39;d take adjustments? Some time? How easy was it to fall into those things like it&#39;d never been something else before, though! His heart was always open for whatever was coming its way, so easily. Perhaps, too easily? Loves and friendships and well, wasn&#39;t there been twice now that it had just made things particularly harder in the end? What was that saying again, never twice without thrice? It wasn&#39;t really fair to compare two different sorts of love though, so it would probably be better if he didn&#39;t. He&#39;d go how she&#39;d go, get what she&#39;d give. It&#39;s not like he hadn&#39;t two mothers already..!</em>

It seemed that she had more or less settled down, and affirming Newton&#39;s words helped to finalise that. They were intended for both parties, subconsciously; it worked as a promise that applied vaguely to her own situation, too. Sure, she hadn&#39;t intended on up and leaving the ship, but she also hadn&#39;t time to let everything simmer. Newt had, and thus however drastic of a measure a transfer would be, she could certainly sympathise with its origin. Blanche herself was tackling with facing things head on, forced to by the day&#39;s onslaught of new information. Freely or not, the doctor was happy for the exercise in standing her ground; painful though it was, acknowledging aspects of her past she had priorly locked away felt freeing, almost. A burden from her shoulders she hadn&#39;t even known was there, it had remained unspoken of for so long.</em>

<em>Not to say it wasn&#39;t all still very <strong>surreal</strong>. It was, and Carlisle caught herself studying him again, having to shake herself out of it with the most sheepish of smiles. She refrained from apologising this time, and folded arms about her middle once again in that reticent nature. The warmth of her features remained unwavering, however, and had it not been for telltale smears of mascara, Blanche might have appeared her usual sunny self. She followed the silence with a brief, gentle bout of laughter, having to glance downwards at the floor in order to keep from staring. Still picking at the sleeves of her cardigan, when the doctor returned her gaze to Newt, it was with the fondness she had always regarded him with. Slightly more complex, indeed, but the sentiment was there.</em>

<div class="quote">Dear Doctor Blanche Carlisle,
</div>&gt; 
<div class="quote">I hope that this letter does not seem too untoward or ‘out of the blue’ as the Human saying goes. It has been some time since I have had the opportunity to discuss phrases and word choice utilised in Standard. The concept of our ‘long rooms’ or ‘corridors’ still eludes me.
</div>&gt; 
<div class="quote">I am not writing this in order to discuss the dictionary, though. I merely thought that writing this letter to you might be… Nice. An update, of sorts, if you would care to read it. Please feel free to discard this if you would not. It would be entirely understandable if you did so.  
</div>&gt; 
<div class="quote">Deep Space 22 was recently shut down. Starfleet deemed it too dangerous, considering how it is on the verge of uncharted space without backup and always without set communications links. Our escapade with our experiment and the devidians pushed Science into deciding that it was better off if the station was shut down. <em>Johannsson</em> will remain active with its current crew and is set to become a standard scouting ship, but the station itself is being dismantled for scrap. 
</div>&gt; 
<div class="quote">As a result I have found myself without a job. At present I have mostly been lingering around Science and the Academy whilst trying to find something to do. I have had the ‘pleasure’ of taking a few lectures when required. ‘Pleasure,’ I would like to inform you, is highly sarcastic. It has been a nightmare and if it were up to me then I would not have half of the cadets commissioned at all, annoying as they are. In the meantime, I merely have to wait for another deployment. The USS Sawhney was supposed to embark on a shakedown cruise relatively soon but delays at Utopia Planitia have resulted in that being put on hold. For now it would appear that I am stuck.</div></span>

Due to this it has left me with quite the amount of free time, and this free time has been spent… ‘Reminiscing,’ I believe that the word is. I am uncertain if this is entirely healthy but I have been doing it nonetheless. I am aware that we spoke during your visit – or rescue – of Deep Space 22. Despite this I feel the need to apologise further. The way I treated you was disgraceful, and after all of your kindness it is entirely disheartening that I felt to treat you that way. I will be the first to admit that I was jealous, and I acted irrationally as a result. 
</div>&gt; 
<div class="quote">I wish that we could have parted on better terms. I miss the <em>Phoenix</em> - our conversations about artistry or ‘cushy’ literature, being locked in the turbolift, the sense of impending doom always weighing over us but never seeming to get in the way of an intellectual conversation. I miss the rapport we had and the sense of closeness which accompanied it. I do not believe that I shall obtain that sense of closeness again: a fault which is entirely mine, considering how I left yourself and Doctor Dev Clark. 
</div>&gt; 
<div class="quote">It is safe to say that I was not ‘in my right mind’ at the time. Coming to terms with the information about my daughter and ex-husband is something that I have strived to do over the past months that I have not been in contact with you. While I do not believe that I will ever truly be at peace with what occurred, it has at least led me to see the errors I made in handling it at the time. I should not have jeopardised our friendship, for example. I only hope that we might one day have the opportunity to set things right. 
</div>&gt; 
<div class="quote">Please do not feel inclined to write back if you have made it this far. I am aware that you must be busy – fleetwide chatter still speaks of the tasks that the <em>Phoenix</em> undertakes. 
</div>&gt; 
<div class="quote">All in all, I hope that you are doing well.

She had managed to exchange medical white for something more casual, but that was about it; the bundle of white fluff eager to leap up into her arms and gnaw upon the sleeves of her ridiculously large academy sweater was proving quite the hindrance. Out of habit, perhaps, the woman looked down to the feline upon the sound. Then upwards, to the entrance itself, and eventually to her own reflection in the mirror across the room. Thankfully, she still looked somewhat presentable. Of course, a visitor necessitated the rudimentary floofing of dark hair — a trying feat, she discovered, when it turned cradling one&#39;s cat into a balancing game. Contented, the woman furrowed her brows briefly, prying blue eyes from the vanity so as to regard the door.</em> &quot;Come in!&quot;</span>

And that’s exactly what it felt like – confines. As soon as she crossed over the boundary between hallway and room it suddenly felt all-encompassing and suffocating.</em>

<em>Why? She forced herself to question, attempting to fall into the scientific approach of analyses instead of delving deeper into the emotional struggle without interpretation. Why was it like that when she knew why she was here? Why was it like that when this was just Carlisle, the woman she had apologised to, the one who she had already decided to leave alone should things go astray? There was no need for this reaction. She was not some infatuated schoolgirl. This was ridiculous.</em> 

<em>Yet it was still near the door that the Cardassian hovered, far enough into the room that the hydraulic hissing sound of the doors closing again was sounded, but close enough that she could turn on her heel and exit in a single stride. Having the exit-strategy planned out in her head was entirely Cardassian, really, but it was also one ingrained deep in this damned emotional struggle. Perhaps it was like a safety net.</em> 

<em>What a contrast they made – Carlisle as polite as ever, clad in clothing which was far too oversized but still somehow becoming of her, creating a picture of a casual grace. And then there was Khassid, regimental and militaristic, with shoulders squared and hands folded neatly behind her back and not a single hair out of place.</em> 

<em>(The perfectly regimented precision of her appearance was broken, though, at the way grey eyes flickered between Carlisle and the door and at how her voice seemed to catch in her throat instead of being clear.)</em>

So painfully familiar in its formal carriage, pristine poise — yet so foreign, in a manner that was equally excruciating. They had been worlds away from one another, and still, there was that slight stammer to the other woman&#39;s words. The paling of Blanche&#39;s face, as if it were a ghost stood in the entranceway and not somebody she had come to love.</em>

&quot;Commodore.&quot; <em>The cat scampered away, unimpressed. She had, after all, dropped the poor thing. Perhaps that was the problem, why she couldn&#39;t seem to wipe the look of utter gormlessness from her features; Khassid was very much there. Unmistakable in her every mannerism. Blanche&#39;s hands remained poised at her middle, eyes adhered to the Cardassian after the validation of one too many fears. One glance away, and she would be gone again. The initial shock hadn&#39;t allowed Carlisle the latitude to think over their last interaction. Akin to her bemused feline, the woman&#39;s stomach plummeted. Truthfully, Blanche hadn&#39;t known of Khassid&#39;s presence onboard. Rather than question how, seeing as the answer would likely reside in her repeated failure to traverse beyond medical, she could only stand dumbstruck with guilt. Annoyance at her own inability to simply respond — a month spent searching for the right words was a month nonetheless, and she felt an utter fool to have left it so long to only seem heartless. Uninterested. Bitter, resentful, indifferent.</em>

Eyes tracked the cat – that was a cat, correct? Not just some snowy ball of fur – as it hit the ground as a result of its owner all but accidentally dropping it. Khassid had looked ill from sheer anxiousness and now Carlisle seemed to match, looking akin to what one might would if they thought they had seen a ghost stood before them.</em> 

<em>And she could understand the reaction, truly. Months upon months apart interspersed with only one meeting and a singular message could not have set a good precedent nor a good example. It was entirely logical that Khassid would have been pushed to the back of the doctor’s mind, content to get on with her life like any smart and dedicated Starfleet officer should have been able to.</em> <em><strong>Khassid</strong></em> <em>was the one in the wrong in that regard. A failure to move on, it seemed, had enveloped her. There was no capability of doing the same in return in regards to Blanche Carlisle. The doctor found her way to the forefront of the woman’s mind all too often, whether it be whilst inspecting framed art or musing over the latest literature that she had read – never having a taste for such works until she had met Carlisle. The thought of this woman was invasive, a complete and utter failure to move on.</em>

It was to two separate therapists that Khassid had confided in following her departure from the USS</em> <em><strong>Phoenix.</strong></em> <em>It had only been wise that she sought out assistance considering the revelation in regards to her ex-husband, after all. One therapist had stated that this was natural; love lost, and lost in such a way, was naturally going to be yearned for and pined after. Another, however, stated that it was damaging and invasive and the beginning of what could fester into abuse. Khassid had latched onto the former, praying for a sliver of her remaining a good person.</em>

<em>The singular word from the Commander’s lips spoke volumes when it was stated, seemingly after quite a moment of shock which had, thankfully, lightened with the faintest of smiles. The smile contrasted with the word choice, though. Carlisle had opted to address her as her rank. Now it was natural, really, considering the fact that Khassid was a senior officer. It was natural considering the shock of the situation, it was natural given all of their time apart. But still it stung like ice applied to bare skin, hissing with the cold. Informality had vanished and formality had been reverted to, it seemed. It was… Understandable.</em> 

<em>The rest of the sentence was kind, at least. There was no malice or sense of coldness there. Instead the coldness was offered from Khassid herself; that standard way of conversing, the one she seemed to employ when getting to know a person for the first time and not fully being comfortable in their presence. It was a form of keeping a distance… And perhaps that</em> <em><strong>was</strong></em> <em>what she was doing, getting to know a person for the first time again. …It was a fact that she did not enjoy.</em>

Blanche had yet to forgive herself, and likely never would; the message in question had only stung, then, in its plea for pardon. Even after all this time, Khassid thought it her own plea to make.</em>

&quot;I didn&#39;t know what to say,&quot; <em>she mused quietly, returning wide eyes to the woman stood before her. Albeit small-sounding, the words were ridden with sincerity, and as such, the woman&#39;s arms had loosened about her middle; there was no use in walls, no use in distance.</em> &quot;And it was . . <em>foolish</em> of me, but I—. You still apologisin&#39; like that, after everythin&#39; I did. Hell, the two of us standin&#39; here like total strangers when we—.&quot;

<em>Her gaze moved to the ceiling, only for a moment. Blanche winced, frustrated by the outburst, humiliated even. Formalities, fumbled words; why was it that they seemed so keen on remaining worlds apart when they were within arms reach?</em>

Blanche’s eyes returned to Khassid, weary and yet oh, so brimming with all of the patience, love, and will in the world for even a sliver of the light they once have. <strong>Still</strong> had, however clouded, for she would not allow for her optimism to be thwarted so easily. Unfazed by the smile that was presented to her, Carlisle allowed for her own to reappear, unabashed in its fondness. Deflecting one apology with another had become some sort of mechanism between the two of them. Blanche concluded, in a state of mounting self-induced agitation, that she may as well <strong>evidence</strong> the survival of that light. Its durability she so fervently believed in, whose snuffing out completely truly <strong>would</strong> break her heart.</em>

<em>She had taken time to visit, willed herself to chime the door. The hesitance Blanche assumed both actions were executed with meant something, didn’t it? Khassid had gotten this far, and she ought to recognise that rather than feel affronted by the desolate feeling looming over them. It didn’t feel so desolate anymore, at least not to Blanche standing there with lithe shoulders drawn up into a hapless shrug. Unable to look <strong>away</strong> from the Cardassian now, there was a gentle shake of the woman’s head as if it aided in ordering her thoughts.</em> “I’ve had time to reminisce, too. I’ve had time, and . . thinkin&#39; about those days, havin’ you here now, knowin&#39; that you <em>are</em> alright—.&quot;

<em>Deck eight never was quite the same without her room across the hallway, that one turbolift hardly as appealing to ride. Hallways as a concept had been rendered dull, medbay left with no sentiment so endearing she felt compelled to remain there indefinitely. Tests of patience were not something Blanche could justify engaging in, not in this case. Not anymore.</em>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace"><em>It was a horrid sensation to feel both distanced and confined at once. The walls of Carlisle’s quarters seemed to be determined to close in upon the two, forcing them together – or that was how it felt. Vision, corrected by those stupid spectacles that her students claimed to emphasise the ‘old woman’ look, proved otherwise. That physical distance still remained with Khassid lingering in the doorway and Carlisle content to stand in the quarters which she called her own, enveloped in a safety net of familiarity. Khassid, on the other hand, had been embraced by sheer discomfort.</em> 

<em>But then again, it would have been unfair to place Blanche in the bracket of some sort of safety net considering how she seemed just as awkward given their present situation. The smile that the woman gave seemed genuine, at least, but Khassid – as attentive as ever – could not help but pick up on the way that her gaze drifted downwards to the floor. It seemed as thought they were continually destined for this sort of interaction, nowadays, ever since the argument of theirs. There was always going to be despondency and the looming negativity seeming to hover in the air, weighing down upon their shoulders. It seemed impossible for conversations to remain positive any more.</em> 

<em>The mention of the letter gave her confirmation, at least, and perhaps a little bit of closure on the case. It had not been a matter of Carlisle ignoring her, it had merely been… An inability to talk, not knowing what to say. Again, it was understandable. Khassid had spent the entirety of that letter attempting to apologised (interspersed with brief attempts at a generic catch up). She had expected something back in turn, even if just a letter of receipt, but truthfully… If she had been in Carlisle’s position then would she have known what to say in return? Would she have stalled indefinitely in the hopes that one day the words might strike her, knowing what to say? Probably.</em>

The apologies had to be Khassid’s and Khassid’s alone. The entire conflict had began due to her jealousy and refusal to treat the topic like an adult should, instead acting like a jealous teenager in pursuit of someone in a soap-opera romance. Blanche had been entitled to make her own decisions and pursue a relationship with whomever she liked. It was Khassid who got in the way of that every time, choosing jealous rage to fuel her debates and throw comments at the woman which were entirely unbecoming of a Starfleet officer. There was no need for Carlisle to apologise, only for that of herself.</em> 

<em>They weren’t strangers. The words seemed to ring in her ears, creating some sort of distorted sound until it was all that the Cardassian could focus upon.

Khassid in turn had remained entirely frozen, tensing before Carlisle even made it close.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace"><em>Stood there with fingers furled into the fabric of Khassid&#39;s uniform, Blanche was left to ponder the sentiment. Her head nestled neatly in the crook of the other woman&#39;s shoulder all-too easily, and Carlisle found that such ease was only accompanied by a mounting unwillingness to let <strong>go</strong>. The tail about her own ankle had not gone unnoticed, hence the endeared, melancholy sort of smile claiming crimson lips as she regarded the doorway behind them. Rather than the room and its priorly claustrophobic dimensions, it was that very entrance that Blanche feared now. It was, after all, an exit too, and the way in which she was practically clinging to the other woman was evidence enough that she didn&#39;t wish to see it utilised any time soon. No, they certainly didn&#39;t deserve this.</em>

<em>Again, there had been an apology, but it was what preceded that ensured the doctor&#39;s smile remained unfaltering. Pulling back to chide the woman would only work to distance the two further, in both senses of the word — after such a yearning for proximity, to dispel it for the sake of having the last word would only be mindless. Mindlessness had deposited them into a state that was <strong>harrowing</strong> to look back upon.</em>

<em>Similarly unable to verbalise her feelings, Blanche hummed in quiet agreement, loath to keep looking at the hydraulic doors and their implications of the inevitable. Instead, she allowed for forlorn eyes to flutter shut, quite content to stand there in fragile familiarity. She did, for some time, and the duration felt equally endless as it did fleeting. Carlisle couldn&#39;t quite place the sensation, but that was often the case when it came to Khassid; before its entanglement into something perplexing, distorted by misunderstanding, their dynamic had been thrilling in all of its complexity.

To a fractional extent, and in such a manner that meant the contact was not lost entirely. It was by way of instinct, most likely, that the doctor failed to let go fully; softly, hands slipped down Khassid’s arms that had found their way about Blanche’s back. Akin to her movements, the doctor’s smile when she was finally able to regard the Cardassian again was mellowed and fond.</em>

“We’re both still standin’,” <em>she noted quietly with the smallest quirk of dark brows. Really, it was quite miraculous given all the two had been through since parting.</em> “And I think we could both do with reinstatin’ that rule I can just about recall — the one that strictly forbade apologisin’.” <em>The ease with which she was able to shift from wistfulness to its playful counterpart, however tinged with melancholy — it only furthered Blanche’s disdain for the steely cold now <strong>just</strong> out of focus behind Khassid. Furthered her every inclination to remain latched on akin to some stubborn child swept up in petulance.</em> 

“I suppose—,” <em>with the notion came a will for closure. Confirmation of the inevitable return to their respective lives; a confirmation that troubled Blanche, evidenced in the slight furrowing of her brow.</em> “I suppose you’ve a lot of work laid out for you given all that&#39;s happened. Surely, you&#39;re entitled to some sort of break as we are? I&#39;d just hate to think of you bein&#39; put through so much—.&quot; <em>Catching herself, the CMO&#39;s countenance softened to a smile slightly sheepish in nature.</em> &quot;Senseless ramblin&#39;,&quot; <em>she finished, the quirk in her lips becoming one that was dry, self-aware. A moment&#39;s pause followed, in which the doctor&#39;s expression adopted a certain earnest air, blue eyes coming to study Khassid&#39;s with concern that could not be more sincere, however gentle.</em> &quot;Where will you go now?&quot;</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace"><em>It seemed as if they could have stayed there forever. The Cardassian would have quite liked to, enveloped in the warmth that came with Carlisle’s embrace. It was not only a physical warmth – although she did appreciate it, being cold as ever – but it was an emotional warmth as well. Such distance and fear and regret had overcome them for far too long. This contrasted heavily to what they had been minutes before and instead threw her back to how they had been before; friends, support networks, and she could not say it on behalf of Carlisle but perhaps they may well have been one another’s saving grace. She could have remained there within that sensation of support, and support being mended, for an eternity.</em> 

<em>It was as such that she was reluctant when the doctor pulled away, more than tempted to make the effort to bring her forwards into the hug once again. Khassid knew that it was not a viable option, though. She had told herself time and time again before arriving here that she would not be forceful. She would respect Blanche Carlisle’s wishes to the extent that if the woman wished to sever all ties with her then so be it. Thankfully their present situation proved that the doctor’s intentions were the opposite, but still… Her original sentiment would remain. No forcefulness, only respect – no matter how much she secretly yearned.</em>

<em>The doctor herself seemed reluctant to entirely sever all ties as well, though, as evidenced in the way her hands lingered upon the Cardassian’s arms. Hands felt warm against the cold despite the uniform jacket being in the way, a testament to how the doctor seemed to radiate with light, ever-positive, ever-kind, ever-welcoming. It wasn’t fair, that attitude. It wasn’t fair how the kindness contrasted so strictly with that of her own and it wasn’t fair how it only made the doctor even more endearing; kindness, as a quality, being something that the Cardassian revered.</em>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace"><em>There was a knowledge that they could not stay there forever. When Khassid relinquished her own grasp that had formed her side of their embrace it seemed to her like the entire room went cold again, no longer fuelled by the doctor’s warmth. Part of her knew that such a concept was idiotic, that of course this was not the doctor’s doing but something deep within her own mind. And why was she conjuring such a thought, such an interpretation? Why, after all this time and all of this desolation, was she still hell-bent that Carlisle was the main source of light in this world? Why was it, after telling herself that she had to move on – after therapists telling her that she had to move on – there was still an ingrained inability to? It was a dangerous attitude, one that could become forceful. She did not like it. And yet it lingered, certain that Carlisle was the universe’s only source of warmth.</em> 

<em>Conversation served as a distraction from the worry and the guilt that followed. It was with arms folded across her chest – an attempt to return the warmth, perhaps – that she listened intently and attempted to forget about the concern which continued to well up deep within. Of course, the doctor’s main concern was upon Khassid and not upon herself. Self-sacrificing as always was Doctor Carlisle, always putting others before herself. She was the sort of officer that Medical were determined to snatch from recruitment. You could understand why.</em>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace"><em>The answer given seemed to appease the doctor, alongside the admission that accompanied it. Concern dissipated, and Blanche&#39;s smile soon regained its whimsical nature. It was partially owed to amusement at the thought of Khassid being hassled by Academy affiliates and students alike; she could so easily picture the woman in a classroom environment, however much of a &#39;nightmare&#39; it had been conveyed as in the message. Something told Blanche the Cardassian didn&#39;t find it quite as hellish as she liked to admit, and she was certain that however inept at showing it, the students were likely more enraptured by what Khassid had to say than she knew.</em> 

<em>Accompanying the image she could only regard as endearing came a sort of wave of relief. An inwardly selfish one, perhaps, for knowing that Khassid&#39;s foreseeable future entailed remaining on Earth came with a promise of relative safety. Comparable to her posting in deep space, at least — San Francisco was familiar, accessible. Though there had been a protest against Blanche&#39;s worrying, the two were probably more than aware that she&#39;d worry all the same. In silence, if Carlisle could help it, to save unnecessary headaches.</em>

<em>Of course, it didn&#39;t take much for sardonic self-awareness to shift into a bashful alternative. The admission was enough for Blanche, whose lips quirked in a demure manner, arms looping loosely about her middle in a subconscious mirror of the other&#39;s actions; a substitute for warmth lost to space.</em> 

&quot;You know I can&#39;t help worryin&#39;,&quot; <em>she admitted, head inclined softly to one side.</em> &quot;But I&#39;ll admit I&#39;ll worry a little <em>less</em> knowin&#39; you&#39;re at the Academy and not worlds away. Perhaps I <em>ought</em> to be worryin&#39; for the students,&quot; <em>although the playful gleam in her eyes suggested otherwise,</em> &quot;I&#39;m not too sure they&#39;ll know <em>what&#39;s</em> hit them.&quot;

Perhaps the two of us&#39;ll be able to catch up properly, and <em>then</em> we&#39;ll see how you feel about my goin&#39; on and on.&quot;

<em>It seemed that the mere mention of Blanche&#39;s rambling only ever worked to prompt more, and thus, the doctor&#39;s countenance seemed to light up in sudden remembrance.</em> &quot;You know, I don&#39;t think I ever said. Medical offered me a transfer not too long ago, and evidently I didn&#39;t accept, but—.&quot; <em>Had she, they might have had chance to properly amend things, rather than in brief instances allowed to them by the vast expanse of space. Carlisle worried that the notion was a selfish one, but ever since learning of Khassid&#39;s return to the Academy could not keep her mind from returning to it nonetheless.</em> 

<em>That, and she could only imagine the duress the department was under all things considered.</em> &quot;I&#39;m not sure I made the right decision. I don&#39;t know, it&#39;s silly,&quot; <em>rather than fidget at her abdomen, the woman opted to rake fingers through her dark hair, laughing airily.</em> &quot;Oh, it seems I&#39;m not too sure about most things nowadays. doesn&#39;t it?

There was no protest to her words, no frustration or confusion or downright revulsion at the prospect of Khassid having ‘missed’ her or their talks. Instead it-  it seemed mutual, really. Or perhaps it was simply that Khassid</em> <em><strong>wanted</strong></em> <em>it to seem mutual, determined to force this conversation and their way of being into the way she wanted it to be. The conflict seemed determined to wage on inside of her head, concealed behind a stoic exterior which only now and again was altered by the nod of a head or the slightest hint of a smile that she hoped did not seem to cold.</em>

<em>She didn’t</em> <em><strong>want</strong></em> <em>her response to seem cold. She wanted to be just as warm and welcoming as Carlisle was, but the stony exterior and icy look that she employed was all that she knew to project. A defence mechanism, perhaps. An ice-like wall to hide behind in the hopes that it would protect the two of them from the thoughts that lurked within. Sands, what a mess she had become, and how desperate she was for Carlisle to never see that mess that lurked beneath. There was no desire to subject the doctor to more pain, no desire to create this conflict or forcefulness but</em> <em><strong>was</strong></em> <em>she being forceful or was all of this legitimate, was it just her, was it mutual,</em> <em><strong>how was she supposed to know-</strong></em>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace"><em>Khassid had missed the first part of Carlisle’s statement, having been worlds away and enveloped in that stupid debate with herself. She prayed that the casual approach she now took – an effort to make it seem like the old days they had once had and the conversations they had partaken in back then – would not seem too false. The slightest of smiles was offered to Carlisle and she attempted to take a more neutral stance, shoulders slumping ever so slightly instead of standing at a strict attention. Was it natural? Falsified? A bit of both? Her therapist was going to hate her. Be genuine, they said, you have to be genuine. It was all she wanted to do here but genuine meant bringing forth that conflict and placing it upon the doctor too. That would never be fair.</em> 

<em>But instead of saying anything or attempting to force herself into some further mode of discomfort she tried to will herself into the casual nature instead. This… Did not have to be so difficult. It did not have to be difficult. Carlisle had reiterated it already; neither of them were strangers to one another. Khassid was over-thinking things as she tended to do nowadays, and she was letting the worry go to her head. There was no reason that this could not be a pleasant conversation between friends – and nothing more – and that it could just… Be nice. All she had to do was try to make that casual and relaxed approach a reality instead of something she could only yearn for.</em>

It gave her an apt distraction, all things considered, and it</em> <em><strong>was</strong></em> <em>pleasant to just hear of… Whatever the doctor wished to talk about. Everything and anything would have been settled for, really. Khassid would not even try to deny it. Shoulders slouched, just ever so slightly further, at the mention of the students being ‘appreciative.’ It was a familiar topic and familiar topics helped; they were a grounding mechanism instead of one that threw her further into the world of discomfort and disarray. And even her, in this stupid, conflicted state, could find the humour in the concept of the students being appreciative of her. Imagine it.</em> 

“I fear I must disagree with you, my dearest Doctor Carlisle,” <em>the statement had been like a verbal form of muscle memory, there before she could stop herself. Don’t think about it, just continue.</em> “My students… Have mixed opinions towards me, I believe. Some are appreciative of the way I teach whereas others find it much too strict. It’s… Difficult to please all of them. And, as for your mention of taking up a post at Starfleet Medical…” 

<em>She paused in consideration. It would have been wrong to attempt to turn it around and talk about her own wants and desires, the fact that they were the direct opposite included. All Khassid wanted was to be back out there amongst the stars conducting exploration and running planetary surveys on strange new worlds. Instead she had been relegated to an office upon Earth, one of the last places she had ever wanted to be found in. Carlisle was entitled to her own opinion. Attempting to question it would only serve to polarise them further, and that was the opposite of what the Cardassian desired.</em>

A brief one; it seemed as though the answer to the question posed resided out there for Blanche, shrouded by the dark vista.</em> &quot;It&#39;s alright.&quot; <em>Contemplative, enough so that it was evident in her expression, Carlisle gazed out again, looking suitably forlorn.</em> &quot;I suppose that&#39;s a part of it,&quot; <em>she started slowly, brows drawn into a pensive furrow.</em> &quot;The comfort of home.&quot; <em>Frankly, she hadn&#39;t much thought about the decision for some time now, neglecting to do so in fear that it might just send her into a spiral of conflict.</em>

<em>Frankly, though she daren&#39;t admit it aloud for the sake of decorum, the very notion of comfort had been something Blanche once derived from the woman stood in her company now. For some time, too; it was undeniable that the two had come to rely upon one another in such a way that was rare, precious. Surely, if that were not true, then the dissolution of it all would not have been so devastating for both women to acclimatise to.</em>

<em>For all of her sunniness, Blanche was more than prone to feeling helplessly isolated. A good number of the doctor&#39;s past decisions seemed to evidence that fact quite nicely. Much to her own chagrin, she was more than aware of the fact — Blanche often pondered what might be of her life if she were less inclined to make rulings spurred by a fear of loneliness. A little less hectic, probably, and far less concentrated with husbands.</em> 

&quot;Then again, I don&#39;t think I do all too well with change.&quot; <em>And how ironic that was, given her prior train of thought.</em> &quot;I think it . . &quot; <em>shoulders rose in another sort of shrug, blue eyes still adhered to the expanse of stars, narrowed slightly.</em> &quot;<em>Scared</em> me, maybe. It still does, in a way; like if I settle down there now, I&#39;ll have settled down there for good.&quot;

She couldn&#39;t quite distinguish whether this feeling of detachment was as real as it seemed, either; it may well have been amplified by Khassid&#39;s presence and the reminder of comfort that came with it.

<div class="quote">Good morning Dr Carlisle, I had a wonderful opportunity to speak with our newest chief of security, and he informed me that you two would be having drinks sometime today. First off, I&#39;d love to congratulate you on getting out there and stretching your proverbial toes in the sand~ And secondly to inform you to change the temperature in your room to 32 degrees celsius should things... Develop.
All the best, I hope you two have a lovely time and please be sure to fill me in on any developments ;)

Blue eyes found themselves drawn to the dress of a similar hue that had been laid out painstakingly atop the bed. Satin and off-shoulder, the sight of it now was somewhat amusing in its newfound irony. Figuring that standing there and gawking at the garment as though it were some artefact of symbolism would only keep Parlac waiting, Blanche opted to head to the bathroom.</em>

<em>And, of course, it was with such restraint that she was able to emerge in a suitable time. Hair was of the utmost importance now, and <strong>that</strong> solicited a good moment allocated to contemplation. Pensive, Blanche sat poised before the mirror for some time; curls were easy enough, given their pre-existing status as her go-to of choice. It was with a certain mastery, then, that the woman set to fixing her hair, noting its increased length that would have to be seen to sooner rather than later. The top was swept up rather intricately, and subsequently secured. Without the use of Cardassian gel, mind, or whatever it was they seemed to favor. It wasn&#39;t long, then, until the doctor had finished dressing herself <strong>and</strong> addressed the issue of makeup. Loath to stray from anything besides a red lip, it was an issue easily resolved.</em>

<em>Most arduous to tackle, perhaps, was the matter of accessorising. Ridiculously, for she always ended up opting for the same, oversized diamond necklace. Blanche sat there all the same, one heel on and the contents of her jewellery box overturned atop the vanity. Needlessly, of course, for it was the diamonds she went with. The rogue pump was shortly located, as was the silken shawl to match the gown —the latter was draped haphazardly about her elbows, and preceded by one last affirming glance in the mirror, Blanche was out into the hallway again.</em></span>

<div class="quote">Greetings, Dr. Carlisle,
</div>&gt; 
<div class="quote">Things have been busy since the fleet ball, but I was hoping you might be able to make room in your schedule for another evening of drinks sometime soon. I would love to know how the rest of your night went after I left you and the commodore. As for me, I enjoyed rather a bit more kanar than I had intended, but it was not a wholly unpleasant evening and I believe you are most of the reason for that. If you would like to join me, let me know what time would be amenable. I have a copy of some of Iloja&#39;s collected works to lend you as well.

It was absurd, the manner in which she had kept these memories so private for so long. Or perhaps it wasn&#39;t, and gate-keeping them as such was doing her more harm than good.

&quot;Alright,&quot; <em>Newt, whose soft little smile was all the reassurance she could ever require. It was reciprocated by Blanche who, with considerable trepidation, began to leaf through the album&#39;s earliest pages. The photos, printed traditionally, were crudely annotated with black marker — dates, locations. The latter appeared to be the same for some time. Earth. Michigan, to be precise, which was shortly pointed out by the woman, newly suspended in a state of fond nostalgia.</em> &quot;He&#39;s not in these first few, they&#39;re mostly of the lakes.

I&#39;d never seen so much water in my <em>life</em>, and he just loved firin&#39; fun fact after fun fact at me.

Newton liked to imagine he&#39;d have a few comments on his own. Perhaps would he have faked being offended at Blanche&#39;s secret inaptitude before breaking into laughter, or he would have revealed knowing all along that she couldn&#39;t, only to say he felt just as unable to tell her that she had felt?</em>

The photographs were no longer scenically staged, intentional in their every angle and crop. No, they were much more clumsy in nature, the first few so hazy and blurred that without the overwhelming mass of blue they might well have been something far more abstract than a lake. Rather than recess into sheepishness at her own ineptitude, remarkable though it was, Blanche could only smile.</em> &quot;These are my first ones; your father was set on teachin&#39; me how to use the darn thing. It&#39;s still a lake, I promise.&quot;

<em>The body of water in question was no longer the focal point of the imagery laid out before the two. It now seemed to be a good mixture of photos taken by the couple, who had evidently found great entertainment in passing the device between one another. Blanche was pictured, significantly younger, perched cross-legged atop the lake&#39;s sandy shore in a fashion that was not dissimilar to the way she was sat now. In what appeared to be the midst of laughter, too, notably absent in her present image. The latter wore a melancholy smile as she turned the next page, thumb lingering over the first photograph that proved difficult to detail.</em> &quot;I think I got a little better,&quot; <em>Blanche mused quietly, poised in anticipation; it felt slightly surreal, to have the two side-by-side. In a sense, at least, and to such an extent that when she eyed Newton sat beside her, Carlisle was able to note similarities that had priorly gone unseen. Denied, perhaps, in the fear of finality.</em>

It seemed his thoughts had drifted a little when he noticed she was the one eyeing him, now. His eyes promptly turned back to the album, whose page had apparently changed, and his mind registered the words she had said as he noticed it. For a second, there was confusion.

&quot;Wow.&quot; <em>was the only thing he could mutter, as this sight was quite clearly something. Like a mirror sending back a reflection slightly altered, yet so much similar. It was almost unreal. See, he had noted the shared blue eyes of commander Carlisle and himself. Even, younger, he had tried finding similarities between himself and his moms, even if he knew he had been adopted. It was a kind of protection against, very few yet still one or two, kids who had deemed funny to try to attack him with questions and &#39;facts&#39; about adopted children. Heh, kids be kids. Back to the here and now, though this was like nothing he&#39;d seen before. Maybe it was common in most families. His own experience was very limited, after all. His eyes couldn&#39;t left the picture, almost comically wide. He felt like he should add something, though another, meek</em> &quot;Wow.&quot; <em>came out.

<div class="quote">I would like to hold a senior staff meeting in the <span class="mention">#conference-room</span> in two days&#39; time. As you all know there is a possible war ahead of us; I would like for us to be prepared as possible. Please come prepared with the information laid out below: -
</div>&gt; 
<div class="quote"><strong>Tactical and Security</strong> 
Please advise on our combat readiness. Commander Arosio, as per our correspondence, please come prepared with details as to the shipwide combat training. If need be, work with lieutenant Parlac. 
</div>&gt; 
<div class="quote"><strong>Engineering and Operations</strong> 
Please advise on the integrity of our systems and operations; if need be please reinforce the same and keep me advised of progress. 
</div>&gt; 
<div class="quote"><strong>Medical</strong> 
Please advise if our medical supplies need to be replenished and of any further such needs. I sense that we will need them desparately in the days ahead, more so than ever before. 
</div>&gt; 
<div class="quote"><strong>Science</strong> 
Please come prepared with information on Iconian culture and their military history. Perhaps it may be of use to us in finding a diplomatic solution - however impossible that might be - or in finding a weakness if it comes to that. This time I sense that merely returning the World Heart will not be enough to quell this conflict. 
</div>&gt; 
<div class="quote">I commend you all for your bravery thus far. I am pleased to see that despite these trying times we remain steadfast in our operations and mindset. Help me to maintain this. Please. We cannot have the crew in chaos ahead of such a monumental battle and you all know that. 
</div>&gt; 
<div class="quote">I hope to see you all there. Stay safe, friends.

She changed to the extent of removing her lab coat and outer jacket, folding them neatly only for Dolly to render the effort redundant. Sparing a pointed, sardonic smile for the feline, her attention was quickly returned to the pile of gifts. The pile of gifts that had been hastily retrieved from the hallway a number of days ago only to be set aside so that she might unwrap them in some semblance of togetherness. Carlisle felt at <strong>least</strong> 50% clear-headed, and Sara&#39;s chocolates that had conveniently ended up in her lap certainly amounted to another ten percent, if not twenty.</em>

<em>They may have also contributed to the ordeal&#39;s duration as a teary one, for the notion of gift-giving was touching enough as it was <strong>without</strong> the added sentiment patent in every one. Blanche was mostly touched, though, to see that someone shared the same heightened perception that blue was, most definitely, her colour. As always, Newt&#39;s contribution was nothing short of precious, and Parlac&#39;s prompted the most fond of smiles — how fitting, she concluded, that his present be so similar and yet so vastly different from the one she had chosen him. That of which was still sat atop her desk, wrapped alongside a number of others she hadn&#39;t gotten around to delivering. Making a mental note of heartfelt thanks to send out in the morning, it was within the captious company of her cat that Blanche drifted off to sleep, exceedingly content.</em></span>

She had spent the first half of it scouring online collections for Parlac&#39;s book. Selfless intentions notwithstanding, it made for quite the . . informative deep-dive. Not that Carlisle minded at all; she was always thrilled to become better-versed in the realms of questionable romantic literature. The triumph she felt upon finding the book in question compensated for some of the less savory titles she&#39;d happened upon along the way. Of course, the entire ordeal also served as some manner of procrastination — it had necessitated focus, best achieved at one&#39;s desk. Sitting behind the desk rendered the need to change useless, and thus, the replication of the new uniform was put off further.</em>

<em>Alas, she could not delay it forever. There had been instructions to recycle the <strong>old</strong> uniform, in an effort to preserve resources. It might&#39;ve been salt in the wound, but god forbid her distaste breed <strong>wastefulness</strong>! Penning a mental elegy for her heels, Blanche eventually surrendered them to the replicator. Her skirt followed, relinquished with that same, deliberate slowness. The new uniform was laid out, regarded with poorly veiled disdain, and set aside for the morning.</em> 

<em>It rolled around, though only after what felt like hours spent staring remorsefully at the ceiling. Hauling herself out of a bed was a chore, a feat owed to the inevitable that accompanied the action. Getting changed. Dolly&#39;s unimpressed looks certainly didn&#39;t bolster the CMO&#39;s confidence, nor did it remedy the woman&#39;s substantially foul mood. In a far cry from usual routine, the mirror was practically ignored altogether; such negligence arose in the fear that if it didn&#39;t, there was a dangerously high potential for tears. Feeling disgustingly <strong>short</strong>, Blanche left the privacy of her quarters.</em></span>

However, as often seemed to be the case, an all-too appealing distraction was bestowed upon the doctor in the form of Parlac’s message. It wasn’t very long at all before she’d readied herself, shooting a brief reply to the Cardassian to let him know she’d be there. Scarlet lips were scrutinised in the mirror, and duly adjusted; minimalism went a long way.

Given the note (and the horribly misinterpreted stance on her personal relations), it was only a matter of moments before Blanche identified the sender. Newton had sent her a gift, and she couldn&#39;t keep the resultingly fond smile at bay.</em>

&quot;Hello Blanche,
I hope you are doing alright! Due to the war and my station&#39;s location I wasn&#39;t able to contact you directly, so instead I hope that this package arrives before the universal day of love, as I know Quackford loved you very much (:. You&#39;ll find a few pictures of the planet, me, and Quackford (pictures, not the duck himself) in the little box, as well as a silver necklace with a yellow gemstone, native to the planet I&#39;m researching, right now it seems that yellow was a prominent color to these people, representing friendship and nobility, and none on the Phoenix carried the noble air quite as well as you.

Much love, until we meet again, 
Cosek&quot;

<em>Bound to the letter was a leather box, a yellow ribbon on top. Inside was the aforementioned necklace, as well as some Polaroid pictures of Cosek and Quackford, in scenic locations on the planet and station, Cosek eating delicious foods, running through the forest and Quackford wearing cute hats. And that was it, nothing more nothing less, perhaps they could speak again someday, but all contact with the station was temporarily terminated, Cosek would never even know if the package arrived.</em></span>

So much so that a mere glimpse of her reflection was enough to make the woman recoil; the image in question was such a far cry from its usual pristine state. To her, it was harrowing. In the same way everything else was, snowballing into an entanglement of promises and responsibilities she couldn&#39;t quite stomach. Not like this, curled up in the window-seat like some discarded rag doll entirely aimless. There had been some instances in which Blanche hadn&#39;t even <strong>made</strong> it to the vast panel of glass, opting instead to hug her knees in the carpet&#39;s centre. What with the room&#39;s size, its floor stretching around her, and the void beyond the window, the doctor was left to feel exceedingly <strong>small</strong>. There was a grounding comfort to the phenomenon, however small; it was almost as though the illusion brought with it an accompanying reality. One in which she didn&#39;t have to acknowledge Amy&#39;s absence. One where its implications were irrelevant, and she was not forced to face the ever-heartbreaking hypothetical.</em>

<em>Of course, there came the occasional reminder that this lull she&#39;d landed herself in was ineffective, comforting or not. Most often in the form of her PADD&#39;s intrusive glow, cutting through the dim she&#39;d become acquainted with. If there was one internal matter she had been unable to blot out to any effective degree, it was guilt. Unsurprisingly, that was, and influenced greatly by external matters that went on as usual beyond her control. Even in such a state as this, Blanche was loath to allow it to devolve into rudeness if she could help it. She would certainly try, and although it took her a good while to string together something that resembled a coherent reply, she attempted to respond to T&#39;Svai&#39;s message.</em></span>

I know this is a difficult time for you most of all, being so close with Lieuten-no, Amy, but I would also hope that you know there are people you can lean on during these times. My ear is always open if you need to talk.

They squinted, taking a good moment to regard the PADD and decipher its contents; the doctor couldn&#39;t help but grimace, its glow deceptively harsh. Of course, her expression softened considerably once she processed the message itself. Yes, there was another pang of that underlying guilt - Blanche <strong>had</strong> been absent.

Makeup was simply out of the question, spare a moment&#39;s attention allocated to cleaning up the mess her eyes had fallen into. Rather than a blouse, she opted for a faded old academy sweatshirt and equally unimpressive jeans, running a hand through dark hair in the hopes that it might result in some likeliness to a human being. Coming to a halt before the door, she found that willing herself past its safety was the most jarring task yet.

<div class="quote">Dear Blanche,
I figure by now you know about Amy&#39;s death. I&#39;m sure like me you were devastated to hear the news. She was as close to you as she was too me. She thought of you as a maternal figure and I know you mentored her greatly. She always looked up to you and wanted to be a CMO just like you. I hope our Amy is off some where in the stars helping other lost spirits find the light. I am not sure how to deal with this great lose to our ships family. I know it would help me to discuss her memory with you and I hope it would help you as well.  Words to not express how sorry I am for your loss. I certainly know the pain in my heart is from emence from her passing as I am sure yours is.
Sending love and support your friend,
Malcolm Parsons</div></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace"><em>Perhaps the attempt to tend to everything at once had been slightly over-zealous. Blanche found herself duly overwhelmed, but felt it would be remiss to retreat back into her prior state of sullenness. Besides, the onslaught of revelations had yet to become unpleasant. Loath to jinx it, she daren&#39;t ponder the thought for too long, or allow herself to become skeptical. When everything was so dreary, questioning a glimmer of light felt redundant. Antagonistic, frankly. A good deal of time was spent in collecting herself all the same. Again, hands and their slight trembling came to cradle her head, and Blanche allowed for a moment&#39;s deep breathing, eyes shut. One, two, three, and all the way to one-hundred before she reopened them, straightening up where she sat.</em>

<em>A smile followed suit, the first that met blue eyes in the excruciating stretch of a week gone by. It was a melancholy one without doubt, but in the same manner she had tackled the first flurry of information, Carlisle was by no means poised to protest. A response was sent to Malcolm after much deliberation, and fingers retreated from the pallor of her face to brush subconsciously over Dev&#39;s images on the monitor. Aptly named, so much so that Blanche&#39;s fragile smile had yet to flicker out. She regarded them for some time, indifferent to the pricking behind her eyes — warmth was all she felt with these tears, no nauseating hollowness. Somewhere along the way, the doctor had brought lithe knees up to her chest to hold them there as she often did. Responding to Malcolm had been exerting in its raw emotion. An honesty she had refused herself for the week, among other things. Of course, Dev and Khassid&#39;s reminder ended up just as useful as it it had been endearing.</em>

<em>Before she even thought about where to begin in replying to Clark, Blanche stood and headed to the replicator. Peanut butter toast was a start, set on her lap while she brought the photos up on her PADD so as to see them better.</em></span>

</div>&gt; 
<div class="quote">Thank you kindly for your touching message. It means the world to me you reaching out like this; I&#39;m equally sorry for the hurt her passing has left you with. There was nothing I wanted more for the both of you than long lives filled with every happiness in the world. I don&#39;t need to imagine the light she will have brought to your life, because as you said, she took it everywhere she went. The thought of her out among the stars sharing it is a beautiful one - it&#39;s easy to see why she cherished you as she did. 
</div>&gt; 
<div class="quote">I&#39;ll admit I&#39;ve been at somewhat of a loss, too. I do agree something so simple as reminiscing would do us both the world of good, though, and am always here should you ever feel inclined to talk. You will always be family to me - I&#39;m certain Amy would want for us to soldier onward, and that&#39;ll be all the easier with one another to lean on.

Hi, Blanche. Er, ￼Commander Carlisle. I’m just sending this. To let you know how truly sorry I am. About Amy. She was a real friend, and I haven’t stopped thinking about her since well. She died. I know you had a better relationship with her. But I just, feel so awful ￼for not offering her a bit of comfort as she passed on. I don’t know why I’m even doing this. I just. I gave flowers to Khassid twice, when she was in a bad spot. To show that uhm, she meant a lot to me. You were there in the room the first, then you probably in sickbay after we saved her from the space station. I just, want to show how much you mean to me, and to the crew I’m sure. And how much Amy meant to me. How much she ￼ deserved these flowers. Thank you for everything you do, and I’m so so sorry.
Maggie Verne</div></span>

If I ever did something that makes it seem like I wouldn&#39;t forgive you which I hope I did not or at least it wasn&#39;t my intention... what I mean is even if it&#39;s not I never could not forgive you for something anything &#39;cause I&#39;ve never hold anything against you.
I can&#39;t fully understand for sure what dad&#39;s death did to you, it&#39;s just not possible. Even with Malcolm&#39;s albeit short one and admiral Ephrix&#39;s and even dad&#39;s death I couldn&#39;t even begin to fathom what it was like for you when dad died and I would never need you to explain or be sorry about those last twenty-three years.
Since you are opening your heart there I figure I should as well, ah? I mean, I don&#39;t wanna hurt you and maybe exhaustion is the main reason I&#39;m actually typing it right now and I might regret this in the morning...
Maybe it&#39;s selfish because in the end it doesn&#39;t, won&#39;t keep me for forgiving it and you without a second doubt and I don&#39;t want you to feel guilty so it may or may not be pointless and counterproductive to write it down but, huh, I guess it does fit in confiding in those we cherish, right?
It did hurt a little bit. For the twenty-fourth, I mean. I&#39;d like to say I understand why but I frankly don&#39;t. I can understand why you forgot and everything, and maybe that&#39;s why I don&#39;t understand why it still hurt. I&#39;ve passed the years of absolutely wanting gifts, and I&#39;ve never quite like being the center of the attention anyway... so, I guess I&#39;ll never really understand it. But, I do understand that although I already forgave you, it still felt... good? to hear you&#39;re sorry about it and so... thank you, Blanche.

She spent a good while in the bathroom, staring blankly at the wall. It was all so thoroughly disgusting, the options laid before her didn&#39;t extend far beyond laughing, crying, or desperately scrambling for a distraction.</em>

<em>One came, with the thought of the ninth deck. Exercise was well-suited for the task of occupying one&#39;s mind, as rarely as she dabbled in it. All the more reason to commit, Blanche concluded upon emerging from the shower. She happened to miss swimming a great deal, and always found it to be far less degrading an endeavour than the gym. Perhaps because she knew she looked good doing it — swimsuit selection, of course, was a vital element. As such, her trusty red number was retrieved from the drawer and stuffed into a bag, hair pored over even if it <strong>was</strong> going to end up spoilt. With that, and a newfound eagerness to submerge herself in chlorinated water, (no, the shower still hadn&#39;t been quite enough), the doctor left her quarters.</em></span>
