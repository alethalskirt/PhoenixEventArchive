Now for the miserable part of unpacking, tossing his PADD onto the top bunk before digging in his bag for his family crest. The six winged angel made for a nice wall decoration and a reminder of home. It seemed too early and too defiant to wear his arm band quite yet., hooking it around a light for off duty later. 

The crisp bright white, sterile and professional, was still taking some time to get used to, adjusting the uniform a few times so he could thankfully get it as fitting as possible. He checked his AG simply out of habit. It wasn&#39;t exactly Starfleet Standard Issue but who was going to be mad at him for being overprepared? He tossed it back onto his bed, doubting anyone could be poisoned in deep space.

Enough paperwork, time for some actual work!</em></span>

The last time they had stopped at a station, besides the latest one that brought new crewmen -including their new captain which he was rather curious to learn more about-, there had been a little package sent to his room. He had recognized the handwriting on the little paper atop the old-fashioned box right away, and said little paper told him not to open said box before &#39;today&#39;s very special day&#39;- well, the day before yesterday, in all technicalities. He had been rather busy. Bruce&#39;s message had not arrived yet, so he was not, again in all technicalities, late to do so. If he himself did not see the importance to celebrate the date of his birth, his t&#39;hy&#39;la seemed not able to omit such celebration each year. It was only logical to follow his ashayam&#39;s wish in order to generate more of his happiness. And, if Vulcans did not feel similar happiness, the item he would be gifted would logically be quite agreeable either way. It was all very logical and had not only to do with their very powerful love, obviously. Vulcans did not lie.</em>

He did <u>not</u> gasped, being Vulcan, and there was absolutely no warm feeling engulfing his body as the sight of the inside. Mayhaps a little bit of the latter, somewhere in there, though. Two little hats and two little, visibly soft blankets who were rat-sized, a carving kit who was definitely hand-made, and finally, a little figurine seemingly of the same collection of the one he had unfortunately lost at the same time as the first carving kit Bruce had given him, during the fight. This one though was a blonde woman in white. He would need to ask him what this one had to do with him, as soon as he&#39;d see his t&#39;hy&#39;la again. Similarly, a message stating &#39;There still one gift left, but we might have to get much, much closer for that one ; )&#39; was at the bottom of the box. His little green blush disappeared slowly as he looked over each tool of the carving kit, who was all in all just as perfect as the previous one. Eventually, he put everything back into the box. He would sooner rather than later take care of placing all those items in his room, but for the moment, the Vulcan had a shift to attend. He placed back the box carefully on the shelf and left his quarters, perhaps a bit more blissful than usual. Not that it showed in any way to anyone, being Vulcan. Well, except to the two little rodents in the room and the human, owner of his heart and his mind even across the stars.</em></span>

Being busy working on a rock (not as, literally standing on a rock, but as sculpting), he did not answer immediately. As no second chime followed, he logically concluded the person had either left or were too shy to chime again. Either way, once he was done with the part of the sculpture he was doing and could pause his work, he left to answer the door. No one indeed, though, there was a little package. Curious, he opened it and- ah. One last look outside his door confirmed the giver was gone. Strange.

Was this the &#39;Secretive Satan&#39; he had taken part of? Surely not, as this package did not possess his name, nor his roommate&#39;s. Thus, impossible to tell for whom it was. Then, the logical conclusion was that this was a gift meant for both the room tenants. As such, he logically transferred half of the box of chocolate (Did the giver somehow knew his secret likening of chocolate and sugar in general despite being a Vulcan? Perhaps that was something to investigate...) into a bowl he replicated, then let the decorated box in view for his roommate to collect whenever they wished. He himself returned to his part of the quarters, settling the bowl next to his work. Back to work, right after indulging in one square of chocolate. He was off-duty for quite some time, after all, so it was logical to take them now and not later.

Quite some time later, the work had surely slowed, and the bowl surely wasn&#39;t as full as it had first been. Actually, the Vulcan had completely stopped working and was worryingly staring at the wall as a sigh escaped his lips. Finally, he got out his PADD and began a call, which was answered a few minutes later. A dishevelled human was looking at the PADD, part confused and part concerned. It kinda was unusual of the Vulcan to make an unprompted call, without any kind of messages him beforehand to be sure he wasn&#39;t on shift, or in this case, sleeping.</em>

<em>There were three gifts inside a medium red box. The first contained two large pots, one of chamomile and one of jasmine.

No one but him could have told, besides the Vulcan itself, that he had been hungover, obviously. It&#39;s not like he had gone to sickbay either to get something against it, some would call it Vulcan pride, but he believed with no doubt, knew really, it was just the common Vulcan&#39;s ability to support pain and such. Indeed.

The first thing he spotted while entering though was yet another gift. One of his eyebrows went up a little bit, like he took a second to weigh if opening this box too would be a great idea, should he find yet another (irresistible- no, terribly addictive) box of chocolate. A second later, he was already opening the box though, as nothing could be stronger than his Vulcan control, not even chocolate (lie) and that&#39;s when another eyebrow went up. 

Ah, plants. Logically, there was an accompanying book to take care of those and he could not help but feel (Vulcan, blablabla, no feelings, blablabla) that he would need it. He had, in fact, never taken care of those. A quick look was sent towards his rats. Well, those were easier. They reacted more clearly, in his opinion, if not fed, or anything, correctly. Not that he would let get to that stage, obviously. Mayhaps could he ask Lieutenant Bj&#248;rge, if he had any additional inquiries not covered by the book. Yes, it sounded like a good plan. Should he give them names? No, illogical. They could not answer to those like the rodents had. Still, he placed Waneti and Kastik on a shelf carefully. He mentally added their care to his schedule.</em>
