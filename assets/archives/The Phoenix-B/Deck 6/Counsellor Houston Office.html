It was something he was immensely thankful for considering how 1. his console and PADDs contained confidential information on patient case files and 2. he hated things being out of place. Should have probably done something about the orchid atop his filing cabinet, though, because it was more than definitely dead. Last time he had Kloie to stop by and water the thing for him but it wasn&#39;t as if the kid was aboard anymore. He would have to send a letter at some point and see how they were doing. He had never had much luck with plants anyway.</em> 

<em>In standard Houston style he set down his PADD upon the desk and tucked the stylus behind one ear. Then he sunk down into his chair, breathing in a slow inhale. As much as this place had caused him grief it also felt good to be back. Just the smell of the diffuser was something he had been missed. And what else had he missed, he questioned of himself as he took a sip of coffee from his travel mug? Replicator coffee.

Olson here, sorry it took so long to get back to you. I’m currently working on a personal project of sorts. But I have an opening in my schedule soon, and I’m open to talk with you about how we’re gonna start the training. Of course, as a nurse, I do have to have some experience in talking people down after they’re injured. And as for you, I remember Phenna mentioning you wanted to undertake training as a nurse? I understand you have the basics down pat, if you wanna tap into that we could certainly use more nurses on board. If you wanna chat your most likely to find me on deck six.

- Salutations, Olson</span>

Subject: Post Post Mission, Yet Again
Hello Counsellor,
I messaged the Fleet Admiral about a few problems of mine, but considering her importance, she must be swamped. Of course, not to say that you aren&#39;t, but I hadn&#39;t thought of messaging you as well until now, just considering that you must be getting settled in right about now.. God I can&#39;t write messages can I? If I can&#39;t tell a counsellor then who can I? Y&#39;know? Either way, if you&#39;ve got the time, I&#39;ve got the trauma, if not, I&#39;m still more than capable of working as I am.

In standard practice, first meetings such as these would act as a consultation to see what sort of service the client required. On starships this could be different though because people often showed up with a singular problem that they wished to discuss. It was a fine line between administration of future sessions and conducting one right there and then, and as a result, the counselling approach had to be utilised from the start.</em>

Cognitive behavioural therapy is geared around talking like we&#39;re doing now. It&#39;s a little more directional though; we can go into understanding base thoughts and reactions, understand how past events can influence what we do now, and help to develop a different point of view. It&#39;s very good for looking at events, our perceptions, and how to change them.&quot;

&quot;EMDR stands for eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing. It&#39;s often used in people who have PTSD or potential PTSD from a previous traumatic event. It&#39;s a different form of therapy instead of one in which you talk it out. It simulates the form of REM sleep in which the brain makes internal associations. You track the therapist&#39;s hand movement across your field of vision to start that state similar to REM, and during it you recall the event and your emotions and reaction surrounding it. The therapist then aims to alter your perception of it to something different using the brain&#39;s own state in which it creates a response.&quot; 

<em>He paused for a moment to look at the Ensign.</em> &quot;There&#39;s a lot to take in with that one, I know. It&#39;s got a lot of depth to it... But it works.&quot;</span>

Because you&#39;re pushing the brain into the state where it utilises these emotional connections plus you&#39;re recalling a difficult event, you can very much become embroiled in it. The outcome is that firstly we desensitise you to that memory and movement associated and then rebuild it with something positive like an empowering phrase, but to get to that stage you have to go through the difficult part first.&quot; 

<em>He paused and shifted his chair a little bit to the side - not closer, but just so he could stay in front of her. An arm was then held out, fingers upon his hands about level with the Ensign&#39;s eyes.</em> &quot;What happens is that I move my hand back and forth in time like this... And your eyes track it.&quot; <em>After a brief demonstration he stopped.</em> &quot;Either that or we can use tapping or a different sort of cue, but this is the one most often used. While doing that you&#39;ll recall the event you want to talk about and work through. It will likely create an emotional response. We keep going and desensitise you to that using the movement, then replace the emotional response with something else. It&#39;s all very psychological but very helpful if done correctly.&quot;</span>

And I&#39;m glad that we can start planning this together. It&#39;s one heck of a step out of your comfort zone considering your previous experience of counselling so I&#39;m very glad you&#39;ve even taken the opportunity to talk with me today. What I can do is take a look at your schedule and come up with a timetable. As a standard we&#39;ll go for sixty minutes and start at six sessions, once per week. This can be altered along the way though; contracts are flexible and it&#39;s all about what you can handle. Is there anything in particular that you would want to see in a contract, just to make sure I can have it noted down?&quot;</span>

Good morning, Lieutenant, and apologies for not getting back to you until now. 

In general terms, a psychological evaluation is not deemed as mandatory for immediate service aboard a ship. If Medical&#39;s own physical has deemed you able to attend your standard duties then you are free to go ahead and do so. If you do feel like you would benefit from a counselling session, however, then you are more than welcome to one. I&#39;ve attached the schedule of myself and the other counsellors so you can book yourself in if you would like. I hope this helps. 

Best,
MCPO, Eshen&#39;strars Houston, Counsellor.</div></span>

He matched the format perfectly with his hands held together upon the desk, fingers entwined. Antennae twitched or moved now and again as he listened.</em> 

<em>There was no interruption at all to the Ensign&#39;s speech; it was a rarity that people came offering information without a fight, and it was a much</em> <em><strong>appreciated</strong></em> <em>rarity. Once they had stopped he actually took a moment - firstly to go through everything that had been said, and secondly to ensure that they weren&#39;t going to continue again. One of the skills was silence... But given the fact that this wasn&#39;t a definitive person-centred and patient-lead session, it meant that a reply wasn&#39;t entirely out of the ordinary.</em> 

&quot;Well, firstly, I&#39;d like to stay that it&#39;s a pleasure to meet you. It&#39;s actually quite sweet to have someone introduce themselves in advance - and it helps us build rapport too. There are a few of us situated on this deck and we cover different shifts, but if you&#39;re happy with speaking with one of us, mainly, then we can see who works around shifts you&#39;re on. Of course, that&#39;s up to whether you&#39;d like standard sessions or just to pop in when you need us.&quot; <em>There was a pause before the question was presented. It seemed as if once they were into it then they were happy to talk - person-centred focused on letting them speak, but Houston always found that people needed the occasional nudge now and again.</em> &quot;How have you found the going without counselling? I know that changes such as that can be stressful, especially when it surrounds an emotional outlet.&quot;</span>

They listened to what they had to say intently before responding rather simply.</em> &quot;It&#39;s good to meet you too. Honestly, I don&#39;t mind who I see but I don&#39;t like telling lots of people all of my problems so sticking to one might be better for me. As for what kind of session, I think I&#39;m more of a &#39;send a message to see if you&#39;re available and visit if you are&#39; kind of person. I like schedules and stuff, but I don&#39;t want to feel forced into talking about stuff if I don&#39;t want to, which I think a schedule will end up doing. And to answer your question, honestly, I don&#39;t know. I got so used to talking to someone and then I just... Stopped. It just happened naturally, really. I came aboard this ship, and then tried to get used to everything, and then we had that Red Alert with the Iconians, and it&#39;s just been so busy I haven&#39;t had chance to even consider sorting out counselling. I&#39;ve felt okay, I suppose, but I think the stress is building up, especially with war being declared when I&#39;ve only been here for like two months.&quot; <em>The more they spoke the more they sounded stressed, anxious, even somewhat emotional.

The number of service users visiting this end of the deck had taken a turn on an upwards trend following the announcement of war and the subsequent attack. It was all natural. People were scared - and rightly so. He would have been concerned if they</em> <em><strong>weren&#39;t.</strong></em> <em>In fact, the most disconcerting were the people who had taken it in their stride; the ones who had seen it all before, or the ones who yearned for this sort of thing so they could earn their stripes. This Ensign (get their name, he still hadn&#39;t gotten their name) seemed to be on the tame end of the spectrum, falling in line with the ones who were stressed or scared by it all.</em> 

&quot;Stopping by when you feel you need it is something easily arranged, Sir. I&#39;d much rather you attended where you felt a talk was required instead of you feeling pressured to attend on a regular basis. If you look up the counselling services directory on the ship&#39;s PADD system then you&#39;ll be able to access a calendar; it&#39;ll show you which counsellor is available for certain shifts and any hours highlighted in green are ones that haven&#39;t been taken yet.&quot; 

<em>There was a small pause in between. For someone who was missing the memory of years of his own life, it seemed that his short-term memory and recollection of what had just been said was spot on (or had made a swift recovery unlike the rest). It was easy to spot how the Ensign concluded the statement, honing in on the fact that they had only been here for a matter of two months.</em> &quot;I can certainly understand how stressful this time can be. It sounds as if it&#39;s been especially difficult for you. You&#39;re not someone sent to this ship to aid the war effort so you would have <em>thought</em> you&#39;d have time to settle in, but instead everything has been uprooted and removed from the norm. Stress, worry, and fear are perfectly understandable.&quot;</span>

Mimicking actions was something that a lot of people did whether that was done consciously or unconsciously. Mirroring body language, copying slight movements - it meant that you were being paid attention to. Counsellors were taught how to do it until it became second nature - and then, once it was second nature, you found you didn&#39;t need it to be at all. You were doing it because of the rapport you had with the service user and not because it would make it</em> <em><strong>seem</strong></em> <em>like you were giving them your full intention. Instead, you always were.</em> 

<em>It was at times like these when the normal and very defined lines of counselling became a little blurry. Generally, the approach that most counsellors followed was a humanistic model. You let a person speak, you didn&#39;t interject, you stayed silent throughout the majority of it and only reaffirmed or reassured now and again. Starfleet counsellors had it differently in that they also had the job of serving in some sort of HR-like position. Counselling sessions were not just about emotional understanding, they could also be about clarification of a role or offering information to further understanding. Counsellors - especially Human ones - would have turned their noses up at the concept. Life within the fleet changed things, though, and Starfleet psychosocial had learned to walk the fine balance. It was tried and tested over the years, after all.</em>

When we join Starfleet we sign the forms and confirm that we understand the risks - that we might be explorers and scientists but we&#39;re also <em>defenders</em> with a fair combative might at our fingertips. For a lot of us we don&#39;t expect to see combat in action. I know that it won&#39;t be easy for any of us, making that jump between the life we considered normal and instead delving into a war. What matters is how we process it. There are days where we&#39;re going to be afraid. There are days where we&#39;re going to be <em>overwhelmed;</em> and it&#39;s on those days in particular that it might be good to come and have a talk with us. Finding coping strategies and ways of staying calm may not come all at once, but there are lots of different things you can try. This is one of them - and hopefully, because you said you used to have counselling before, talking during a session might be something that you find therapeutic.&quot;</span>

I mean I don&#39;t drink so the bar is out, although I don&#39;t remember if it has a blackjack table or not. If it does I could go there for that, I suppose. I like gambling games when literally no money whatsoever is on the line.&quot; <em>They said with a slight chuckle, before continuing.</em>

&quot;I only go to the mess hall for lunch but I usually just read stuff on my PADD or plan what I have left to do in my shift. As for the observation lounges, I see them as more of a... Group hangout location, or a place to be by yourself. Not necessarily a place to make acquaintances with people. Of course you have the holodecks but again, unless you actually know someone you won&#39;t have anyone to hang out with. The gym and pool also exist but aren&#39;t really my thing. My work keeps me in shape.&quot; <em>They said, pausing again to think for a moment, before speaking again.</em>&quot;If you have any suggestions I&#39;m more than willing to take them. I do want to try and socialise more with people, but I also need escape routes in case it&#39;s too much, you know?&quot;</span>

Or being straight-forward with people can also help. We&#39;re in a more open and thoughtful day and age where people tend to understand others more. If you say you can&#39;t be somewhere or partake right now then they should understand - and you might even find a friend in who goes to check up on you.&quot; 

&quot;As for the rest... The bar, as far as I&#39;m aware, does do all that sort of gambling stuff - and without money most of the time, because who wants to put GPL on the line? I believe they&#39;ve also got non-alcoholic options, seeing as how this <em>is</em> a fleet vessel. The mess hall is usually a relatively good one... And remember that a break is a break; you don&#39;t have to be working through it. Do you have any hobbies that you like to pursue? There&#39;s a directory of different groups and clubs on the ship&#39;s system. You might find something you&#39;re interested in there.&quot;</span>

&quot;You&#39;ve said that you would prefer to steer away from the gym or the swimming pool considering how your work on duty keeps you active enough. If you <em>would</em> like to try a sport then perhaps something a little less energetic, like yoga or mok&#39;bara? The latter is technically a martial art but it&#39;s very fluid and meditative. Other than that... If it&#39;s organisational work that you do and that you find calming, then maybe something on the logical end? 3D or Jokarian chess... Or maybe some sort of collecting? People collect <em>countless</em> different things - currency from different worlds, models of fleet starships. Some make functioning little replicas and test them out on mock flight routes in stellar cartography. Maybe something like that might have some appeal to you.&quot;</span>

<div class="quote">Hello.
I don&#39;t think we&#39;ve talked, though I did leave a Christmas card on your door. 
I wonder if at some point I could talk to you? I&#39;m currently stuck in sickbay for quarantine so I can&#39;t exactly come to you. Would it be possible to talk over comms or video message?
</div>&gt; 
<div class="quote">Whenever you&#39;re able of course.

And perhaps the most difficult of all - and a feat that had took a fair bit of forcing himself to do - had been acknowledging the death of Lieutenant Parsons. They had gone from brief catch-ups and him planning out her next steps to work through the counselling course to... Well, to her not being here at all. It was difficult, dealing with the stirred up memories. First his father, then one of his pupils, then his husband, and then a student and fellow colleague. It felt... Odd, off-putting, and entirely not real. He had always found that acceptance didn&#39;t sink in immediately for him and that instead it took time. Things would keep moving. Life would keep ticking on for the rest of them. It would just take time.</em> 

<em>At least things had began to settle down towards the end of the week. More people were signed off and went back to duty and things settled into normalcy again. No longer was his calendar full - there were gaps here and there, gaps that hadn&#39;t been there in a very long time. Perhaps what had happened had hit people hard; knocked them into the realisation that this war was very much real and that all they could do was live with it. Some people still struggled, though, whether it be with the war or something else. It was such that he was ready as the door chimed, setting aside his work as usual and hitting the button to allow the doors to slide open.</em> &quot;Just come in - the door&#39;s unlocked.&quot;</span>

It was easier to express emotion that way - and it was also more instinctive, falling back upon it as emotions increased. As a result it was almost surprising that King had done that so early into the conversation, but then again, the fact that the man was nervous had hardly been a secret. Houston replied in the Andorian tongue too, happy to swap if it made things easier. It had been quite some time since he had spoken in it.</em> 

&quot;That depends, really. Some people who have been through trauma can develop different coping mechanisms. One can be a darker humour, the other can be integrating the memory of bad events and thinking of them alongside others, thus meaning that you speak about it in a more casual manner. That can also be a sign that you&#39;ve never <em>properly</em> spoken about it, though. Have you ever been able to talk through what happened?&quot;</span>

It had been him desperately trying to convene with Starfleet Psychosocial and trace him down when he had gone &#39;missing,&#39; only to be found stowing away within the depths of the uninhabited decks. He had known of the experiments, and as such, he could clearly visualise what Lieutenant King had seen. It wasn&#39;t the sort of thing that young fleet officers should</em> <em><strong>have</strong></em> <em>to see. The rest, though... The rest was disconcerting. It was difficult to even imagine but he honed in on the wording - had King himself been forced to believe that he wasn&#39;t alive? Had he had to endure some sort of falsified sensation of his own death? Houston&#39;s expression remained set on that compassionate gaze, but internally, the thought itself seemed repulsive.</em> 

<em>King&#39;s reaction made sense - and even more so if you went along those lines. Recounting such a thing was enough to send anyone into a potential panic attack. Recounting the fact that you had</em> <em><strong>died</strong></em> <em>but not died - possibly not having been able to breathe - meant that the memory itself was being stirred up. While Capri drew his feet up onto the edge of the chair to curl into a ball as best he could, Houston shuffled forwards just a tad. His voice shifted a little; speaking lower and more slowly, pausing in between so his words would sink in.</em> 

&quot;Capri, I want you to do your best to listen to me. Try to focus on my voice. I need you to breathe in time with me, nice and slowly. I know it&#39;s tricky, but it&#39;s going to help. I&#39;ll do it with you. We&#39;ll breathe in for four, hold for seven, and breathe out for eight. In time with me, now. In for four... Hold for seven... Out for eight. Let&#39;s keep going with that.&quot;</span>

Your timing is impeccable, it would seem. I&#39;m not sure what aspect of my word choice you&#39;re referring to, as l believe it provides an accurate picture of the situation at hand, but in any case, I&#39;m available outside of Beta shift for the foreseeable future. However, that excludes the next few hours, as I had an unfortunate encounter with some of the invasive organisms from before. Thank you in advance for your assistance in this matter.

&quot;It is illogical to suppress emotion, because, as you say, it can affect one&#39;s thought processes without them being aware of it.

Or it had been partially ignored. That was quite understandable, though. He didn&#39;t expect a person to suddenly change their entire viewpoint. Childhood years were a person&#39;s most formative and having something drilled into you from such a young age meant that naturally the ideal stuck with you. He certainly wasn&#39;t going to argue with the Lieutenant, just... Gently push.</em>
 
&quot;You mention not experiencing emotion <em>at all,</em> but you&#39;ve also mentioned - in that same sentence - that it can influence your thought process without you being aware. As I said before, you might not <em>consciously</em> experience and process these emotions, but your subconscious certainly might. Take stress, for example, considering how that&#39;s what the other officer referred you here for. You might not think that you&#39;re stressed at all but it can start building and create an impact on your health. Headaches, muscle tension, difficulty sleeping or meditating, outbursts of anger or anxiety. Continually suppressing any form of emotion and hiding it away within your subconscious mind is <em>going</em> to create a bodily response. I understand that you&#39;ve been taught not to &#39;experience&#39; emotion, as you say, but there&#39;s a possibility that you <em>do</em> experience them - but you suppress them.&quot;</span>

It was easy to see where the fear came from; it was self preservation, wasn&#39;t it? Did he</em> <em><strong>remember</strong></em> <em>the event or was he simply aware of it from some sort of third party? Could he remember having been killed before and being made into some new clone instead? The thought was sickening, but either way, he continued.</em>

&quot;...Starfleet aren&#39;t in the business of pushing people out of airlocks for experiencing emotion, Sir. I understand that culturally you might have these specific rules and regulations and ways to live, but... It sounds to me as if you&#39;re just experiencing <em>life.</em> Maybe it&#39;s something you haven&#39;t had the luxury of doing before. What you <em>do</em> about that depends entirely on yourself, but... I don&#39;t think you&#39;re doing anything wrong - not in our eyes, anyway. If the Dominion disagree - as unfair as that would be - then they would be seeing things from another cultural point of view. If you&#39;re very much set on changing things, though, then perhaps you might want to look into methods utilised by other species who prefer to stay factual and focussed? Something like Vulcan meditation, maybe..?&quot;</span>

<em>It wasn&#39;t often that Houston got to see a change of setting. Normally all he saw was this office, his quarters, or the pool. Now and again he might venture down to the mess hall but that was a rarity in itself. It was as such that he was actually rather looking forward to heading out for this session - although there was a hint of trepidation at the fact he had no idea of what sort of holodeck programme Lieutenant King might choose to run. Locking down his console and picking up his PADD, he had the computer set the doors to auto-lock behind him and then headed out for this rather irregular session.</em></span>
