There had been no sense of deception from the woman – everything she had said was entirely real. ‘ Watch your back, Ephie. You might just be seeing Jamie again sooner than you think.’ The threat – and the tone it was conveyed in – sent shivers down her spine every time she thought of it. She wanted to say that Woystusyu wouldn’t go to such extremes, but now the truth had set in. The fellow admiral</em> <em><strong>would</strong></em> <em>do exactly that. She was willing to eliminate the entirety of the Breen; the admiralty weren’t going to stand in her way.</em>

<em>How was she supposed to tackle this? How was she supposed to stop someone when she had no idea which allies were on Woystusyu’s side? On the march back across campus to get to medical she got in touch with Security, requesting that they track Woystusyu’s movements and communications. As soon as she had gotten to her office she was typing up a message for the fleet. If her fellow admiral intended upon setting a plan into motion now then she was going to act first.</em>

Somebody appeared to be stopping the order along the way - and the only people capable of that would be Intelligence. She should have expected it, going by the suggestion that their field agent had raised during the meeting. Woystusyu had likely been in touch with their group. With Command and Intelligence rallied together a war was imminent. There had to be something they could do.</em>

<em>It was with this in mind that Phenna was now hastily headed to the transporter pad on the other side of the medical campus. She would start with the Dunant, Inglis, Carnegie, Phoenix; it was entirely possible that mutiny against Command might be their only option. Medical didn&#39;t have the capability but with assistance from the other vessels they might stand a chance. If one ship stood their ground, the others might follow. They needed to come to a diplomatic conclusion on all of this,</em> <em><strong>now,</strong></em> <em>before Woystusyu got her way.</em> 

&quot;No, Kara,&quot; <em>she was speaking into her commbadge no as she headed across the campus,</em> &quot;she was right. She was completely right. I should have been rallying people earlier. It was foolish, <em>completely</em> foolish of me to think she wouldn&#39;t go through with it. She <em>wants</em> to start this war, she <em>wants</em> to commit this genocide. No, no, I don&#39;t know why. And I don&#39;t know how to stop her. We need to rally the fleet. I&#39;ll be there in five minutes, we can talk with the rest of the UFHC, and then we&#39;ll start with the others. We have to convince them to stand their ground. Yes, yes, I <em>know</em> she&#39;s technically the commander in chief. Yes, it&#39;s because of Nazar. I know- Kara, it&#39;s too late to appoint someone else, we don&#39;t have time. Yes I know that led to- Kara, <em>please.</em> We don&#39;t have time for this. I&#39;ll speak to you shortly. Ephrix out.&quot;</span>

She could barely remember the process: a brief argument with Wash, walking right into the wall before managing to storm out, beaming back to the medical campus. The place had been almost devoid of life. Every officer and cadet and NCO alike had been deployed; the rest of the admiralty had vanished... And despite the lack of people there was still an aura of tension everywhere that crackled like a gathering storm.</em>

<em>She had dragged herself through a sonic shower in an effort to get rid of the blood which marked her face. Clean uniform on - looking like a ghost with how her pallor seemed to match the white of that medical uniform - she had set to work.</em>

<em>Accessibility options on PADDs and consoles were a pain but fighting through it was a necessity. Dictation software and text input in braille was a lifesaver; countless messages were sent out to the rest of the admiralty in a plea for them to return. There wasn&#39;t time for concerns about Intelligence stopping communications at this point - she had to try. PADDs littered her desk displaying the work; holographic displays of the fleet which shifted between that display and braille, messages to countless people, ship schematics of Starfleet vessels, latest reports of Breen locations, combat capabilities and formations and co-ordination messages between ESD.</em>

<em>The admiral&#39;s head had ended up resting upon one of the PADDs, having finally given in to the incessant migraine and all but passing out at her desk. One arm was still bundled in a sling, the other draped across the surface of her desk, head nestled into the crook of it, seemingly unconscious for now. PADDs still flickered with holographic displays and verbally spoke out reports - not like she could hear or see any of it, though. Dune&#39;s comms call had chirped through the console, totally unheard.</em></span>

Images and footage, judiciously chosen  from the day he was assimilated into the Collective, assaulting him, overwhelming his thoughts: the Borg rampaging through the transport. The screaming. Drones rampaging through the hallways, assimilating, shooting, conduits exploding. The Collective&#39;s uttered mantra, playing on repeat. You feel a sense of extreme, overwhelming fear: this was what the old Federation&#39;s ways have wrought. So many lives, lost to the Collective, as shall many more, and believing in the old way was the cause - a way which would only lead the Federation to ruin.</em> 

<em>A soothing voice plays, comforting, motherlike: <strong>This does not have to be the way. Let us help you...</strong> The scene freezes, rewinds... and the image changes. The very same transport; but this time, the drones flee. Run in fear, transport away or fall as they take fire... and the cause? Starfleet officers, standing proud and tall, rifles in hand - with it came an immense sense of relief and overwhelming joy. So this was what things could be! How wonderful. How beautiful.</em>

<strong>This is the new way. No more pain. No more hurt. You will be safe, and so shall all of your friends. We will all be safe. The time of rebirth is now, and you can be part of it. Join us, dearie. It will all be worth it.</strong> <em>More scenes: the once-dangerous Klingons, running in fear, cowering before the might of the new order. The Dominion, the Founders and their foolish underlings shrinking away at the sight of their rightful betters. Even the Republic and her citizens bowed deep to the people Federation. An overwhelming sense of satisfaction. This was the right way; no more threats. No more danger.</em></span>

Within its walls, many of those who Woystusyu&#39;s campaign had impacted had recovered and since left to rejoin the world, filled once again with new hope, new life for the future that had yet to be written.</em> 

<em>All, except one.</em> 

<em>The Kelpien sat silent in bed, golden eyes open but lacklustre - nowadays he talked to few, using words only when need be. Pulling the foreign, synthetic ego from his mind had been painful enough; realizing what he&#39;d done while not himself - and admittedly, while himself - had been worse. Far, far worse. His own mouth had issued those orders, his own incompetence as a captain, as a <strong>leader</strong> - in a sense their failure to do many things before had been his fault.</em> 

<em>He&#39;d let them down. All of them. All 1,400 of the good people who served under him. His world was but rubble; it was a miracle that he hadn&#39;t turned the worlds of any others to the same.</em> 

<em>And right now, under the proverbial rubble he lay, no longer willing to move. No more missteps, no more blame. Since being purged of the other consciousness he heard them in his dreams - a cacophony of voices, his own crew and beyond, mocking, name-calling, laughing, blaming. They manifested to him sometimes, too, apparitions, figments of his own imagination that came at night, stood over him, laughed, pointed fingers, taunted. The wellspring of regret that he kept firmly dammed behind his mental walls had overflowed thanks to section 31&#39;s machinations, and it was with that that they&#39;d found a means by which to bend him to their will.</em> 

<em>It was suffocating. A weighted blanket in the worst sense, pressed down upon his chest, squeezing the air and will from his person - and the scariest part? He was ready to succumb. At least he wouldn&#39;t hurt anyone else that way.</em></span>

<em>A PADD sat on his lap, screen showing a duly filled in letter of resignation from service.

<em>He&#39;d improved since Talos came by, definitely; complete sentences now rather than muttered, clipped phrases or words that he&#39;d took to hiding behind for the past few days. It was as if the part of him that granted him his trademark fluency had been locked away.</em> 

<em>Poseur. Pretender. Letdown. More of the same. The words tumbled round his mind, nipped at the edge of his conscious like termites to their meal of a particularly tasty wooden slab. Did he want them to go away? Maybe. Did he <strong>try</strong> to make them go away? No. Why bother? They described him, didn&#39;t they? Why fight what he knew to be true?</em> 

<em>And then there was the letter. It sat open on his PADD, still unsigned - he&#39;d read it over and over and over, trying to convince himself that it was for the best. But no matter what he did he found that his thumb simply would not press down, give the affirmation that would release him from his worries at last. It hurt, and yet it didn&#39;t. He found it hard to separate which thoughts were discretely his, and which discretely belonged to the synthetic consciousness that he&#39;d supposedly been purged of. Yes, this hurt as well - and yet it did not. A strange feeling, to be sure.</em>

Of course, Dunamis had likely known she was approaching. There was always the distinct click of heels against the polished floor of the corridor beyond, followed by a muffled crash as she walked directly into the wall outside. No matter how hard she tried this wall seemed to be the one she could not perceive correctly. Every time she told herself to step to the right and avoid the wall and it never worked. Typical that the patient who had been the most in need of assistance would reside in this room rather than another.</em> 

<em>Whenever she visited she would find Dunamis staring at that PADD. Every fibre of his emotional aura conveyed the fight behind the decision – or indecision, rather. Dunamis had to come to his own conclusion on it all. There was no way that she was going to force him to stay or force him to leave the fleet, but the indecision was going to continue weighing down on him. Sooner or later he was going to have to settle upon what he wanted to do. Perhaps the latest news from the meeting with the rest of the admiralty might help to sway him one way or another.</em>

<em>She would not bring that up out of nowhere, though. Conversations with service users always had a format. You built up the pleasantries and ensured they were used to normal communication before springing something upon them. With that usual slightly-shuffling gait she wandered across the room to the window, unlatching the blinds.</em> “I take it that Jiaclek has been in to see you overnight? The woman is a wonder but honestly, she has to learn that not everyone is Reman. Some of us do not do well in the dark.” <em>Of course it did not matter to her – but being kept shut away like this was an easy way to drive someone further into a state.</em> “How are you today, darling?

<em>How naturally the lie was conveyed was almost scary. Everybody knew the state that Starfleet and the Federation had found themselves in because of Woystusyu the first time, and then a second time at that. Work had been conducted non-stop in order to repair the damage done to Starfleet and co-ordinate with the Federation as a whole. Then there was the matter of the Breen, the Klingons, the Romulans… And on top of that there was the day-to-day work of Starfleet as well to keep the place running. It had been non-stop. It was difficult to remember the last time that she had slept, considering how nights were used to co-ordinate the medical fleet and days consisted of numerous meetings. Even just being here had been pencilled in to a very tight schedule.</em> 

“You’re more than allowed to not feel yourself, do remember that. It’s only natural after a trauma – and considering the extent of what you went through I would be surprised if you did feel like yourself instantaneously again. Everybody changes after a traumatic experience, no matter whether an alternate personality is involved or not.” <em>One hand remained grasped around the PADD which she barely ever set down. The other unfurled the second set of blinds. There was a wistful sigh at the sun beyond – the warmth of its rays was one thing, but the view of the sunrise was something she missed.</em> 

“There isn’t an easy explanation for anything when it comes to psychology either, I’m afraid. We did our best to remove that alternate consciousness but personalities and memories and emotions are very resolute things. It does not take much to alter a person’s katra. Hints of that consciousness may still linger in your mind. Whether we remove that via standard therapy or look into alternate options is entirely up to you. We won’t ever force you to do anything.”</span>

<em>Slowly she wandered back over to take her place at his bedside. As always she gently nudged the chair back into position – exactly one metre from the edge of the wall and half a metre from the side of the bed. People were always so careless when it came to moving things. Others going about and re-arranging furniture had swiftly become the bane of her existence. She was rather tempted to begin gluing furniture to the floor just so it could not be put out of place… But that was probably excessive. If anything, she just needed to stop relying on the memory of a room’s layout and get better at using telepathic vision instead. It would be so much easier if this had been innate to her. She really did envy the Aenar at times – that and their ability to continuously use telepathy without it being so</em> <em><strong>draining.</strong></em> <em>Being a hybrid of only one telepathic species was such a downside.</em> 

<em>That was going to be an issue if they went to the prospect of using telepathic intervention, too. There was no way that she was going to let another member of her staff carry this out. It was too dangerous to them and too dangerous to Dunamis. Issues like this took subtlety and precision and countless rigorous training to be able to navigate a person’s mind. She had learned that the difficult way. It had only made her focus harder on being able to conduct such a task correctly without bringing any form of consequence upon the patient. Instead the consequences were rerouted to</em> <em><strong>her.</strong></em> <em>Empathy and telepathy would undoubtedly short out for a time – and if the task required too much work then there was the prospect of further damaging her brain.

“What we could try is something called telepathic intervention. It’s a method in which we – and we being I, unless you would prefer someone else to carry out the procedure – enter your mind with you. It’s a similar sensation to a mind meld. We can navigate your mind and establish what has happened. We could see if there are any remnants of some stray katra imposed upon you by Section 31, or if the issue just requires* <em><strong>time</strong></em> <em>and therapy in order for you to heal.

Sometimes something like this did not help in the end, but it would at least offer them some guidance. Oftentimes people thought it would be an immediate solution. If only it did. It would make things quite a bit easier.</em> 

&quot;...But it would at least give us an answer – and give you the opportunity for closure. It’s a way of knowing the best step to take next. If we manage to discover part of another katra still residing within your own then it might well help with this sense of duality you’re experiencing. I just want you to be aware that change might not come immediately. You’ve still been through a trauma, you still need to offer yourself time to heal. I just want you to be prepared in case nothing changes automatically. It won’t mean there’s anything wrong with you; it’s just how things go, sometimes.”

“But remember – you know that those thoughts are not from yourself. You know who <em>you</em> are, and what you’ve been through, and that they tried to change you. You’re already doing fantastically by being able to make that distinction. Now it’s just about honing in on that and refining the ability to ensure that the distinction can work on details and underlying thoughts and processes, too. I know you can get there.” 

<em>She paused to tuck a strand of platinum hair behind her ear.</em> “When we carry this out it might well be quite daunting. There’s no guarantee of what sort of memory you might end up at. I can influence that but not entirely change it. But if you feel like you don’t want to continue then you’re allowed to stop at any time, alright? We could come back to it another day. And - we can carry this out whenever you feel ready. That could be today, tomorrow, weeks to come. You are going to be able to influence your own recovery. If you’re not ready for something like this than it’s perfectly alright. Just whenever you are ready.”</span>

But please try not to fixate on what happened, alright? Guilt makes for an awful companion and it will consume you if you keep giving it your attention. <em>Every</em> Starfleet officer makes a mistake at some point. I&#39;m sure that they would understand. The circumstances were dire, everyone was under an incredible amount of pressure - and you would have been dealing with the brunt of that, what with being in command. If they were angry at you it&#39;s likely because they were experiencing the same stress as well. People act poorly when under duress. I&#39;d wager to say that there quite a few people aboard the Phoenix who owe one another an apology, not just you.&quot;

<em>She went quiet, pausing to rub beneath her eyes. Suddenly the guilt was not his but her own. It was herself who had continually pushed for the Kelpien to be given responsibility after responsibility. It was as much an error on her part as it was on his.</em> &quot;You hadn&#39;t even been through the Command programme, had you..? You went straight from chief tactical officer to first officer without any training. You only had experience in that position for a few months before you were all but pushed into the position of a commanding officer. You were given no formal training, you had no one to fall back upon for guidance. You should have never been forced into that position, as much as you might have wanted it. I can openly admit that it was myself who kept pestering my colleagues to let you have the role. I didn&#39;t even realised that you hadn&#39;t been through the training. I should have been smarter than that - I suppose it&#39;s the reason why I&#39;m not in the Command division. I owe yourself and your crew just as much as an apology as you do.&quot;</span>

No matter how many times you stepped into another person’s head you never seemed to get used to it. Every interpretation was different; the visual portrayal of a mind meld was never the same. Everything was unique to the person. Some were a cacophony of voices, some gave way to memories which you could file through like an archive, some ended up as a mass flurry of thoughts and feelings and recollections that needed to be put into place. Some portrayed themselves subtly but in a familiar way – as was the situation right here.</em> 

<em>The setting made far too much sense. The endless novels – all of which were horrendously old and outdated and all from Earth – was continually reflected in the way the Kelpien spoke or wrote. The dual emotion highlighted the conflict; the way that familiarity brought comfort but the future brought fear. And the officer… That was K’Pora Vacult. There had been quite a bit of conflict between the two – she remembered attempting to counsel them and solve the problem. Perhaps the Kelpien’s subconscious was bringing him back to sources of guilt, unresolved conflicts, anything that disrupted him.</em>

<em>It seemed his subconscious was just a good an author as his conscious mind, too. The symbolism in the officer tearing out the pages of the book was evident. Guilt at mistakes and failures was tearing apart what he held dearly – familiarity, happiness, the prospect of a future.</em></span>

The incessant background music slowly petered out, leaving her alone with the two of them in silence once again.

&quot;Are you sure you want to go in there, aunt Phen? You might not like what you see.&quot; <em>&#39;Kennox&#39; informed her.</em> 

&quot;He&#39;s hardly worth saving. What kind of leader makes assumptions about his followers before they&#39;ve had a chance to prove themselves?&quot; <em>&#39;K&#39;Pora&#39; added.</em> 

<em>Okay, maybe he hadn&#39;t really heard them both talk a lot. Their voices sounded about right but their inflections and speech were off. But for what it was they represented well enough the feelings he kept bottled up inside; Fear. Regret. Feelings that wandered his mind every so often, messed up the cozy, warm space from which he drew strength. Each and every time he&#39;d picked the books up, restored them and put them back where they belonged. But not this time. Not fully.</em> 

<em>She could hear something else now. Voices. <strong>A lot</strong> of voices. Voices that escaped under the chained door, drifted out, carried on the air. Was there air in this space? Was that even relevant? Eh, who cares? Laughing, chattering, maybe a few hard thumps and groans of pain - groans that distinctly belonged to Dunamis. The contents of the conversation, or conversation<strong>s</strong> going on behind the door were unclear at this time, though she would be able to tell that the tone was mocking. Some seemed vaguely familiar to her as well.</em>

&quot;We came from there. How much fun it is in there!&quot; <em>&#39;K&#39;pora&#39; gave a snort of laughter.</em> &quot;Why don&#39;t you go join in?&quot;</span>

She had no idea of how much longer she could have kept this telepathic connection active with that plaguing her. The image of this room had already began to fade to black at the edges, every sound and noise becoming more distant as the call of reality crept in. She had been right when she presumed this was not going to be a simple task - and was going to be one that she really shouldn&#39;t undertake.</em> 

<em>Another moment to analyse the change. This felt like being forced to pick apart a novel for every detail and its symbolism. Not as if she usually minded but in this case she did. She simply did not have the time. The pages suddenly being returned to the book was likely an improvement, as well. Did its place on the floor still indicate its ability to be trod upon, perhaps, unwilling to properly be restored to life? There could have been numerous interpretations. And then there was still that door now coupled with a cacophony of sound from beyond. Sound... Something that she wasn&#39;t supposed to hear, this mental projection something that she was not supposed to see. Trawling through mental mindscapes in comparison to the reality of the real world was agonising. The contrast was too great. Her brain was no longer equipped to physically handle these two senses and yet here she was,</em> <em><strong>having to.</strong></em> <em>Time was limited</em> 

<em>&quot;Dunamis, I know that it feels like you&#39;ve been chained. You&#39;re going to have to realise that you have the ability of fighting back. You can break free of those chains. I need you to take the first step for me, okay?</em> <em><strong>You</strong></em> <em>have to do this, and I know that you can. Just focus. All of that emotion is what makes you</em> <em><strong>you.</strong></em> <em>Don&#39;t let anyone else control you. You need to remember who you are.&quot;</em>

<em>The plea made sense. As soon as there was a projection of the two different sides of himself that was when she could step in and erase it. The first part just had to be down to him.</em></span>

The door swung open... revealing the bridge of the Phoenix, which appeared to be filled with people and in a state of utter disrepair. At least a thousand people, all dressed in section 31 black. How they all fit was a mystery. The voices heard were familiar because the <strong>people</strong> were familiar: the crew of the Phoenix, both past and present. Talos, Logan, Mackenzie. Zanmar, Korvas, Blanche, Ezran, Kun and more, everyone who he&#39;d served with in recent years and cared about.</em> 

<em>But more than that she saw also the six members of the away team whom he&#39;d nearly sent down and killed by sheer negligence. They too were dressed in section 31 black, but their expressions were blank, pallor sickly, eyes glassed over and empty. The three security officers he&#39;d killed in a mind-controlled state were present too, in the same undead state as their compatriots. Like they&#39;d been raised from the dead. All of them seemed to be mercilessly attacking someone in the centre, some gloating, others goading and laughing. From the centre of the impossibly large mob came whimpers of pain and groans. As if their victim was ready to succumb, but would not.</em>

<em>In making the poor decisions that he had, he felt that he&#39;d let down the legacy of the ship, a legacy that extended to the people who had, and continued to, give the ship it&#39;s name, for without them they&#39;d be nowhere. And this was the extent of his guilt at having failed them. How crushing.</em></span>

At the same time, though, it made her wonder what must have happened in his past to make a grown man so sensitive to name-calling and the sort of bullying that a child might throw around. Surely there must be something else behind it. An adult wouldn&#39;t be so sensitive to such a minor thing if not.</em> 

<em>They had been over this as well before. The concepts of mistakes or wronging people or carrying out actions that were not actually his own. The trauma of being forced to watch while he, not being in control, had to carry out such attacks would undoubtedly be difficult to move past. What Section 31 had done to him was going to be difficult to move past. This fight was up to him, though. She couldn&#39;t fix everything for him. She couldn&#39;t drive out these images and thoughts and suddenly make him who he was again. That was his own fight. She could only guide him - and if some forced alternate consciousness did decide to present itself, then she could remove it.</em> 

&quot;I know this is difficult. I know that these people hurt you - and that you hurt them. You have to focus, though. What they are doing is not real, it never was.

The avatar was dressed in white captain&#39;s uniform, woefully unaware of the changes that&#39;d taken place over the course of the past few days. In his hand was held his commbadge, tightly, knuckles white from the effort. Like a source of comfort or strength. The commbadge itself seemed to pulse weakly with light - like a sort of beating heart. Free of the surrounding darkness now it was free to glow, and with it his resolve. Maybe. Minds were funny things.</em> 

<em>But that wasn&#39;t the only thing that wae happening, however.

<em>Unconscious projections of symbolism meant nothing now. The counsellor was well aware that Dunamis here still had hope, she did not require yet another reflection of that being presented. Quite frankly, they did not have time for any sort of mind games.</em> <em><strong>She</strong></em> <em>did not have the time. Ah - that was quite possibly the reason why the manifestation of that alternate consciousness was trying to stall, then. With every second they waited the likelihood of this consciousness being removed was lessened. As soon as she knew that the Kelpien&#39;s own consciousness was secure then she could work. All that was required was for Dunamis to fight back.</em> 

<em>With quick strides she walked straight past the Section 31 manifestation of him - or of that agent they both seemed to have encountered now. A hand was extended to the Kelpien. &quot;Come on, darling. Let&#39;s fix this.

It was an indication that beneath it all, the Kelpien was himself - and he was willing to fight to</em> <em><strong>be</strong></em> <em>himself again. It was a glimmer of hope amidst the darkness that Section 31 had created. He would make it out of this alright.</em>

<em>&quot;You don&#39;t need to worry about me. What you need to do is ensure that you keep fighting. Do not give in to him. You have an opportunity to learn, the chance for a better future. We&#39;re going to help you. You can be stronger than him.&quot;</em>

<em>Eyes which were normally unseeing drilled into the other representation of the Kelpien. There was the distinct sensation of the world beginning to shift - fading away into specs of light. It started with the representation of the bridge and then moved to the people themselves - dissipating into familiar  white stars, the room beginning to swirl with purple until the old image of that nebula was built. Chasing stray fragments of a katra was always easier when there was a representation - extracting it from the other part of a person&#39;s mind was difficult. It took a lot to influence a person&#39;s thoughts, a lot to transfer a consciousness such as this... But swirling stars had soon encompassed it in a void between their two minds, lost to the mental connection.</em> 

<em>Dunamis could be free now, he could be himself. He could work on rebuilding and repairing without someone else trying to influence his way. This was what had been required all along.</em>

<em>The world went silent, devoid of thought. There was no more torment from that other consciosuness. All that remained was the memory of the event - a reminder, so that he could know his own strength and know he had the ability to move on. He needed to find a sense of pride in himself.</em>

<em>The stars flickered out to black.</em></span>

I&#39;ve told it far too many times.&quot;</span>

She despised administration but had opted to continue with it afterwards; anything to stay within the fleet and in the only world that she knew of, but then there had been the rest.

She hadn’t even known there was somebody else with them. No name had been given but the apology at the end confirmed it – it must be Nymeria France talking. There had always been a conflict between the two. If not working together, medical and security often ended up working against one another. France favoured direct action, Ephrix was a complete pacifist. It was no wonder they had never gotten along… But those words conveyed in tiny braille dots meant the absolute</em> <em><strong>world</strong></em> <em>to her. Apologies, reconciliation; a conclusion.</em> 

“Please, Nymeria… You don’t have to apologise. <em>I</em> was too harsh to you. We were both caught up in the midst of a war, we both had different viewpoints… And we are both rather fond of standing our ground. We were both doing what we thought was right in the moment. I truly am sorry for being so harsh to you.” <em>She rubbed at her eyes and couldn’t help but give a light laugh which was quite evidently on the verge of becoming a sob instead. She had never expected this to be so difficult… Likely because she had never expected this day to arrive.</em> 

“I know that I do not look like I’m in twenties. I probably look like the world’s worst train-wreck at the moment considering I can’t even see to do my own hair. And Kohl… I’ll be truthful. I don’t want to leave. But it is about time that I stopped being so foolish and realised that – as Nymeria said – everything comes to an end. I wouldn’t have been able to keep up with the division’s work like this. It wouldn’t have been fair on anyone else; the UFHC can’t <em>afford</em> to fall behind.

Chief Medical officer of the USS Howling Wolf, species: Betazoid/Human hybrid. Worthy Notes:  Their main focus was field surgery and vascular studies. Noted for her bravery on the field as well as her works with blood transfers/infusions and restoring blood types to former hosts. The list goes on and on but I dont think I should bore you with a list of possibly dozens.&quot;</span>

With a slight bit of a struggle considering how she was both attempting to keep hold of the braille PADD and move at the same time using only one functional hand, she finally turned her wheelchair away from the sun to face the (presumed) direction of Kohl.</em> 

<em>It was that movement that highlighted just how unwell she looked. Hair (no longer pinned back but left loose) had taken on an ashen-grey colour, facial features seemed sunken, far too much of her body weight seeming to have vanished. She seemed</em> <em><strong>gaunt,</strong></em> <em>and it was painfully obvious that the typical smiles and reassurance and kind tones were a fa&#231;ade.</em> 

<em>Colleagues had been threatening her for over a week now. &#39;If you don&#39;t drink anything we&#39;ll put you on a drip. If you don&#39;t eat something and don&#39;t take your insulin we&#39;ll have to inject you with glucagon. If you don&#39;t stop all of this then we will have to section you.&#39; It would be so ironic - her, being sectioned. Colleagues all felt guilty and she felt guilty about bringing this strain upon them too. She knew the fight before her - she had guided countless people through it - but there was nothing like having to face it for yourself. Having them prescribe her anti-depressants did nothing. At least if she was confined here then she would still be within Starfleet&#39;s grasp. How was she supposed to survive without Starfleet when Starfleet was her entire life?</em> 

&quot;It&#39;s alright, Kohl. I brought it up. It&#39;s something that needs to be worked out.&quot;</span>

My own staff have already filled out their section of the paperwork... And considering how I have the awkward position of being the head of a division and also a fleet admiral, it requires two signatures from the admiralty.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace"><em>Being found in the depths of Starfleet Medical’s ICU was not untoward for this doctor. She could often be found milling amongst the patients and checking up on the work of her colleagues, ensuring that everything was alright. People had expected this to stop, considering how the young woman had just been appointed as Starfleet’s surgeon general. Everyone had expected her to vanish from the wards and take up an actual office, perhaps, instead of working while on the go – but in the past week she had been found here even more often, largely confined to the depths of the back of the ICU.</em> 

<em>The main location she could be found was in a specific room. Tending to the patient there was the job of her colleagues, of course. Benji was more of a visitor than anything… Not as if that stopped her from reading over the patient’s vitals and monitoring everything as she went. Every morning when she first arrived she could not help but check over everything. ECG electrodes, nasal cannula, central line, atrial line, IV cannulas, and then all of the readings.</em> “Your blood pressure is too low,” <em>she would mumble almost every time.</em> “We have you on controlled drugs, <em>how</em> can your blood glucose still be unstable..?” 

<em>The denobulan-betazoid always made the worst patient. The past year had been medical hell for her and it only seemed to keep getting worse. It was strange, thinking about it – that this time it had been</em> <em><strong>directly</strong></em> <em>her own fault instead of it being accidental. Benji didn’t like to think about that prospect. Nobody here liked to think about that prospect, and that was why Medical had ended up so tetchy recently. Things were being blamed on other departments, hate was being thrown around, and no one could confirm exactly what had happened recently considering how their patient could not explain. Brain surgery after brain surgery and being induced into a coma would do that to a person.</em>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace"><em>Benji had taken to talking as she worked. She would pace around the lengths of the room and mutter away as she read out from a PADD and made calls to different people. Becoming the head of Medical had actually come naturally to her. The only issue was staffing – that had been thrown all over the place – but everything else went smoothly. She enacted quarantine protocols on stricken worlds, arranged the evacuation of officers on war-torn planets, had the Saurian ambassador transported back here when she came down with the fever, co-ordinated the UFHC’s ships… It was easy, but it still didn’t feel right. Normally this was a position that she observed and commented on instead of ran for herself. That was why she always read it out. The other occupant of the room would not respond to what she said, but it felt wrong to conduct all of this without conversing first.</em> 

<em>Not as if there was any way of knowing if she could hear it. Their consultant neurologist had worked to fit auditory brainstem implants during one of the surgeries. They had no idea if it was working, but initial scans were promising, at least. That was why there was a continuous light classical music playing through the room – inducing a person into a coma via drugs was one thing, but knocking them into a sleep cycle which was designed to let the brain heal and repair? That was another, and it was far more useful. It had been a joint idea of herself and Wash’s to try it out, using the same strategy the patient’s mirror counterpart had used. It felt wrong, a little bit, but if it helped to repair the damage then that was what mattered.</em> 

<em>At present, Benji was doing her usual – pacing the lengths of the room, reading out from her PADD, listening to the chime of monitors and trying to ignore the classical music which was on repeat. Thank god she had managed to get the others to take Klingon opera out of the playlist, she couldn’t stand that.</em>

Weary blue eyes looked down at Phenna&#39;s prone form, their somber gaze barely betraying the grief and loss that lay behind. She wasn&#39;t quite gone, of course, and he knew that, but she was lurking pretty damn close to the border that separated the worlds, the living and the dead. Right now she was dead to the world - and dead to him.</em> 

<em>Not that the Andorian himself didn&#39;t look close to death&#39;s door, either. He&#39;d ostensibly lost weight, somehow managing to look even more haggard and aged that he already did. Work, work, work. That&#39;d all he&#39;d been doing for the past few days. Trying his damn hardest to keep her off his mind for one damn minute. He hadn&#39;t eaten much either - his aide wouldn&#39;t stop reminding him to eat when he&#39;d said (again, again and <strong>again</strong>) that his appetite was lacking, and that he had better things to tend to than his own creaky mortal body. Just before coming he&#39;d forced himself to take a bowl of redbat stew, if only to prevent himself from falling flat on the floor in Phenna&#39;s presence. Unconscious or not he was sure she&#39;d find a way to chide him for it.</em> 

&quot;How is she?&quot; <em>He asked, stern and grating. His right hand twitched, yearning to reach out, take her hand in his and hold it tight - never mind its newly acquired coldness. It pained him greatly to only be able to stand (or sit) at her side, talk to her in hushed tones and hope that she heard him.</em></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace"><em>No matter how many times the admiral crept in, he never failed to absolutely terrify Benji when he spoke. Somehow she was always completely engrossed in her work that she didn&#39;t even notice the doors opening - only realising it was him when she spoke. And just like every time it was the same today; physically jumping, dropping her PADD to the floor with a clattering sound, and then having to kneel down to retrieve it again. It took a lot for Benji to dislike a person but Kohl... Kohl managed. His voice was grating, he would scuff his feet across the floor... He was scary, really, and she didn&#39;t like it. Instinctively she tucked her PADD under her arm and dug a hand into one pocket - squeezing a stress toy in the shape of a doughnut, one which was always in her pocket no matter what. Nice textures kept her from a sensory overload that Kohl&#39;s scuffing and dragging his feet and talking tended to bring. The music she could handle, the monitor chimes were like a part of her brain - but when he joined in, it turned into a cacophony of noise that she struggled to handle.</em> 

&quot;God- uhm, morning, sir. How is- Well. Same as before, really... Relatively stable; temperature a bit low, blood glucose too high, blood pressure too low... But other than that? Stable. The latest surgery seemed to go well, we were getting normal readings from the prefrontal cortex, finally, so... Mhm. S-Stable.&quot; <em>As soon as the answer was given she opted to dip her head again, almost like an attempt to stay out of the way of Kohl&#39;s gaze.

<em>A moment of silence, then. She didn&#39;t really want to bring up the subject to Admiral Kohl th&#39;Ereven.

Within that service record gap - aged seven.&quot; <em>She paused to tap away at her PADD.</em> &quot;...The Ephrix family have a complicated genetic history. For years they&#39;ve been trying to purify their bloodline - hybrid species aren&#39;t meant to have kids, you see? It&#39;s dangerous. Even today it still requires a lot of medical intervention and you can still be left with issues. <em>She</em> swore she would never have children of her own because of that, but then things happened anyway and even worse; the child was denobulan-betazoid-<em>human.</em>&quot;

<em>Benji turned the PADD around to show the picture she had found. To the left was Phenna, looking more civilian than Starfleet in attire, hair far more blonde than the silver it was now. To the right was a man dressed in the old red Starfleet uniform. Tall and dark skinned, Kohl - if he knew the story - could identify him as Jamie McClaren. Situated between the two was a young child in a wheelchair. The boy&#39;s limbs seemed contorted, face drooped at once side, incapable of breathing unaided by the looks of it considering the nasal cannula. Despite that, he smiled. Even from a distance you could make the features out; dark eyes, denobulan ears, but no facial ridges.</em> &quot;That&#39;s Seann.&quot;</span>

After everything that Starfleet and the Federation as a whole had been through this year… They really did not require any more drama. It had taken long enough to wrangle the Admiralty back into some coherent form, it had taken long enough to go through the masses of casualties and assist those they could, there was the issue of replacing starships destroyed, honouring the fallen, trying to stabilise the Federation leadership again and… No, any further issue really was not required.</em> 

<em>Reasoning with him was something that she had tried before. It never seemed to work but it was always her default in the hopes that one day, he would agree. The man had been raised in a timeline of horrible conditions leading to a horrible life… If only he would accept the offer to change that. As always a smile was given to him – although it wavered a little towards the end of the man’s speech.</em>

 “I hope that this project of yours isn’t anything malicious, darling. I think you’ve done enough damage in the past… The Federation doesn’t deserve anything else. Remember, Elija, that if you ever want to put that mind of yours to good use instead of running projects for Section 31 then Starfleet will <em>always</em> be here to help you.” <em>As long as it isn’t with something clandestine – that part went unsaid.</em></span>

For a fair while everything had seemed desolate; everyone from the most experienced of staff to the newest of students had been deployed to assist in efforts following the devastation caused to Mol&#39;Rihan. Even if you were only running inventory there was still a part to play for everybody. It was lively again, though. Students had once again returned to regular classes and could be found frantically running in between lectures or lingering outside, discussing their latest learning.</em> 

<em>The sensory garden within the quad had been designed with its name in mind; used to help wounded officers or families who were prone to sensory processing disorders and acclimatise them to their surroundings.  In had swiftly turned into a well known revision spot when it wasn&#39;t in use, and as such there were cadets dotted here and there, conversing about reading materials and the likes.</em>

<em>In the centre of the garden there was a pond surrounded by a mosaic-patterened patio and the masses of flowers and other plants. It was a good few metres back from the pond that Phenna remained - breaks on her wheelchair very firmly applied considering how she didn&#39;t want to take a trip into the pond itself. Her PADD was neatly balanced upon her knee, reading through the latest reports which arrived. How amusing it was that being discharged from the fleet somehow ended up with more work than you had done before. She didn&#39;t have a single complaint, though. Better to be made useful - and hopefully she could be of use to Lieutenant Olson who she was waiting for. Hearing from the woman and being presented with her interest in pursuing counselling was fantastic. Hopefully the nurse&#39;s enthusiasm hadn&#39;t waned in the time between them meeting.</em></span>

&quot;Lieutenant... It&#39;s allowed to be a &#39;big deal&#39;. Change is difficult, and when it comes to the ones we&#39;re closest to? Then the difficulty increases. I&#39;m sorry to hear that he was transferred. I&#39;m sure that he would wish you well, that he cares. And it may not seem like it, but this feeling won&#39;t last forever. You&#39;ll be alright, and so will he. It may be a clich&#233; but time does heal.&quot; 

<em>It was then that she glanced aside to the young officer. Those strangely starlit eyes were clouded purple, easily unseeing; but for once she managed to focus upon the lieutenant.</em> &quot;And that&#39;s why you&#39;re interested in pursuing counselling, isn&#39;t it, sweetheart? To help others through this sort of thing instead of being consumed by it. To help <em>them</em> heal. I only hope that you know to put your own health first.&quot;</span>

&quot;You don&#39;t need to worry, Lieutenant. You don&#39;t need to explain yourself to me. It would be quite hypocritical of me to say no to your case. I&#39;m well aware of the sorry state that the Phoenix&#39;s staffing is in - I&#39;ve been trying to fix it for quite some time but there always seems to be a vacancy. It&#39;s why I took to staying aboard that ship for any length of time to try to help bridge that gap in the number of available counsellors.&quot;

&quot;I would be more than happy to welcome you into a counselling course, darling, and I&#39;m <em>very</em> happy that someone has noticed this sort of discrepancy and is willing to step up to help fix it. I know that you&#39;re more than able to, and going by what I&#39;ve read in your file-&quot; <em>she tapped her nails upon the screen of her PADD to indicate that may well have been what she was reading over before.</em> &quot;-you&#39;ll do a fine job.

&quot;Generally a starship counsellor covers all bases and may specialise, but every patient that comes to see us is different. It&#39;s like working within the medical bay; you have to have a wide knowledge in order to help whatever case is presented to you. Behavioural therapy is certainly something that you can study - and it can be applied quite often in mental health counselling.&quot; 

&quot;In terms of <em>how</em> you&#39;re going to study... I do have an idea I&#39;d like to propose. Scuttlebutt has it that you&#39;re quite invested in teaching others within the medical field, is that right?&quot;</span>

&quot;No, I&#39;m glad that you&#39;re interested, darling. It&#39;ll save you from trying to attend remote learning sessions, it&#39;ll give you experience in teaching someone else...

Considering how you already know the basics of psychosocial support - you do remember your CALMER training, correct? - I don&#39;t think it&#39;ll be too long until you have the basics of person-centered psychotherapy.

It was good to be back in a familiar space, surrounded by familiar scents. She supposed they didn&#39;t call it the sensory gardens for nothing.</em>

&quot;Things have been well! Our shore leave was incredible, the new and improved ship is so delightfully lovely..despite what couldn&#39;t be saved in the arboretum.

It was noticed, of course, radiating through the woman&#39;s emotional aura all of a sudden. Phenna had thought that Bj&#248;rge may well like it here, wandering amidst that joint project between medical and science that had been conducted quite a few years ago, now. But of course the poor botanist would yearn for her own arboretum - or grieve for how it used to be.</em>

<em>During the restoration of Mol&#39;rihan and the fleet she had been entirely focussed on</em> <em><strong>people.</strong></em> <em>What sort of bringer of life and light was she if she had failed to consider anything else? But then again, anything that was not people was not her forte. It was with a definite Q-like curiosity that she regarded the idea, though. One would never know what might happen until they tried. It wouldn&#39;t be too difficult to make a little after-the-fact adjustment; a click of her fingers and a bit of concentration and hopefully that arboretum may be restored to life. The Continuum wouldn&#39;t care about something so minor. Should she? Probably not. Perhaps later, so as not to seem suspicious.</em> 

&quot;I&#39;m sorry to hear about your arboretum - if you&#39;re interested in anything that we have here then please do let me know, I&#39;d be more than happy to put you in touch with the team who worked on it all. The &#39;subtractions to the team&#39; that you mentioned, though. I caught the transfer note for Commander Burns. How do you feel about his position being opened to someone new - and do you feel as if you have the right support to get the department through that interim period..?&quot;</span>

I&#39;m always open to new friends in similar fields- but I don&#39;t want to seem greedy and pick through their hard work just to integrate it into my own.. I do have a backstock of seeds I can use- but a lot of what I&#39;d had planted were endangered species, plants for my Toxicology dissertation...gifts. Some stuff just for looks and fruits, but- I&#39;ll take that offer and run with it if it means maybe making some more botany friends~&quot;

<em>She grinned widely, shrugging her shoulders in a slightly cheeky manner to indicate her only barely witheld excitement on the subject.</em>

&quot;But yes, a lot of us were incredibly sad to watch Commander Burns leave- but he&#39;s finally doing what he&#39;s always wanted to do! So it&#39;s hard to be too sad about it- I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever seen him grin so much in one day. But I figured as his assistant, it would be my duty from day one to upkeep the work roster and update logs and..you know..do all the stuff he normally does until a new CSO could be found. It&#39;s not intimidating work, just touch more people-chatting and paper work than normal.&quot;

<em>She readjusted the bouquet once more, realizing she might have to carry this for the admiral until they got to her office or somewhere there was water..and a vase.</em>

&quot;But I surely don&#39;t mind, I have an excellent rapport with the science officers..Is..that why I&#39;m here? Because- I actually <em>was</em> beginning to compile a log for suggestions from other science officers about what they did and didn&#39;t like about the commander so that when we got a new CSO we could give some handy-dandy tips on how to more effectively run the department on this particular ship.&quot;</span>

Paperwork, co-ordinating with other people, compiling a list of what worked and what didn&#39;t... The Lieutenant already had everything sorted and something made her doubt that the woman had even been asked. She seemed like the sort willing to take tasks into her stride and pursue what she knew was right - a quality that was required in anyone in a position as an assistant department head. The rest of the admiralty had admittedly had their reservations when the previous captain of the Phoenix placed Bj&#248;rge into the position of ACSO. Their worries hadn&#39;t been required. It was quite evident that she was doing a marvellous job.</em> 

<em>What was equally as impressive was the woman&#39;s own confidence. So many officers shied away when asked questions and attempted to downplay themselves and their abilities. Bj&#248;rge was seemingly the opposite; more than content to speak about her pursuits of rescuing endangered species, toxicology - fascinating topic - dissertation, rapport with the rest of the crew, work that she was conducting at the moment... It was refreshing to see an officer</em> <em><strong>happy</strong></em> <em>with their pursuits instead of being meek and embarrassed about them all. It was just another quality that made her a perfect candidate. Lack of experience had been a concern but she had clearly surpassed expectations in the past. With a line of support to Starfleet Science and the backing of the department behind her, there was no doubt about it that Bj&#248;rge would do a fantastic job.</em> 

&quot;You&#39;re <em>almost</em> there in the reason why you&#39;re here, Lieutenant. This list of yours sounds like a fascinating idea...&quot; <em>There was the sound of the wind chimes and nothing more as she paused for a moment.</em> &quot;Would you be willing to integrate this list by yourself?

She didn&#39;t see the way the poor woman almost dropped the bouquet (nor was she aware that Sara was holding it at all), nor did she see the way the poor woman blushed. The sudden shift in radiating emotion, however, said everything. It was actually rather heartwarming to experience. The surprise, a hint of confusion, then giving way to pride and excitement.</em> <em><strong>This</strong></em> <em>was one of the most rewarding parts of the job, and</em> <em><strong>this</strong></em> <em>was what she was going to miss.</em> 

&quot;Your lack of experience has been completely mitigated by your work so far. You have the rapport with the others, you&#39;re furthering your own education within the field, you&#39;re willing to broaden your understanding in other disciplines, and I&#39;ve listened over your bridge officer exam and the notes attached. Making a former Tal Shiar officer cry over the sensation of hope you instilled... That is quite a feat.&quot; 

&quot;And don&#39;t worry, sweetheart - you don&#39;t have to want to do good. You&#39;re <em>already</em> doing good. I believe that you&#39;ll do fantastically, and if you do ever get stuck then my colleagues at Starfleet Science are more than happy to lend a hand.

The majority headed inside at this sort of hour anyway, labs and seminars over for the day. It created almost a perfect quiet other than the soft melody of the wind chimes strung from the occasional tree. Phenna was more than happy with how things had settled down and the quiet had fallen over the campus. The racket that was being caused earlier hadn&#39;t done much to negate her headache.</em>

<em>She had been rather content to be left alone to her work, opting to stay here as opposed to heading to her office. Well, not her office, technically. What</em> <em><strong>used</strong></em> <em>to be her office. Operations apparently had refused to remove her name from the plaque upon the door, though, certain that at some point her rank would be reinstated. There were more reasons than just that to why she didn&#39;t want to head there anyway. It was far more pleasant out here, it was warm with the sun beginning to sink from its position in the sky... And her office still felt</em> <em><strong>wrong</strong></em> <em>considering how she had been kidnapped from the building not too long ago. The entire campus still felt vaguely unsafe. It was something that she didn&#39;t like, and something that she would have to process... But that would have to wait considering how there was suddenly somebody approaching.</em> 

<em>There was a distinct jolt at the voice. Footsteps hadn&#39;t been picked up, far too soft, and the voice was barely audible as well. The emotional aura belonging to the speaker was one she did not know... But it was familiar, somehow. An officer she hadn&#39;t spoken to in a while, perhaps? Out of courtesy she &#39;looked&#39; to the newcomer and offered a smile - content that</em> <em><strong>they</strong></em> <em>were not here to kidnap her, the person not projecting a hint of deceit.</em> 

&quot;I don&#39;t believe we have, no - but I could be wrong. My memory is rather abysmal I&#39;m afraid. Might I know your name?&quot;</span>

Our bringer of mischief should never have brought Starfleet into the Borg&#39;s line of fire - things were far better off until he decided to play factions just for his own personal amusement.&quot; 

<em>She shook her head then. Better to leave that sort of conversation be. The Lieutenant Commander&#39;s explanation had conveyed that the woman was Liberated Borg - how else would she have acquired such information - and there was no need to stir up a fuss. Purposefully creating negative emotion in a conversation which could remain civil was just pointless.</em> &quot;I shouldn&#39;t focus on that sort of thing, though.

It&#39;s more than natural that such a thing would occur, considering how your mind would have been <em>programmed</em> to make such a connection. It&#39;s going to take time for you to be able to disassociate the two and come to understand that regeneration is as much a valid method of rest as anything - and that it&#39;s technically bringing <em>life</em> to you, not death.&quot; 

<em>She tapped her nails off one of the rims of the wheel, considering for a second.</em> &quot;It might be worth speaking with a counsellor trained in Jungian therapy. You&#39;ve already identified the immediate problem which you would like to be addressed which is perfect. That counselling approach works to bring the unconscious and conscious into a proper balance; and with the dream analyses involved, it might well be a method of helping you to find peace with regeneration as opposed to fearing it.&quot;</span>

&quot;For one, Commander, your qualifications matched. Your scores at the Academy were all but exemplary and your technical knowledge is exactly what&#39;s needed aboard a ship such as the Phoenix, what with it being a science vessel and all. Information on your previous postings all indicated that you were personable and knew how to get on with a crew, both outside of work and within the workplace. You know when to be kind, you know when to set your foot down and be a little more stern. I believe that you have the correct familial approach that the Phoenix operates on, so you would fit in perfectly there... And besides. Every starship is important, and every officer is important as well. You have the ability to do great things and there was no reason for me to not set you back on that track.&quot;</span>

&quot;If there is anything that I know about the people aboard that ship, darling, is that they are forgiving. Time and time again they face so much hardship.

Night had fallen over the campus and it had left the path around the gardens illuminated in a soft glow from the small spotlights which lit the edges, bringing stained glass and mosaics to life in a wash of colour. Classes were over for the night which left the area deserted; no sound of chatter as people rushed from one lecture to another, no frustrated arguing about coursework or debating over different medical techniques. All that remained audible was the sound of leaves rustling within the trees above, and the windchimes amongst them quietly chiming out their song.</em> 

<em>Wheels of her wheelchair crunched against the gravel as she made her way down the spiralling rings of ramps that made up the garden’s exterior. It was in front of the pond that she took her place – it was the same place as always, of course, memory and memory alone leading her to find her way there every time. It seemed as if the ducks had vacated the pond for tonight considering how there wasn’t a sound from the pond just ahead. It was probably better that way. She didn’t want to scare them.</em> 

<em>The air seemed cold, almost, but it wasn’t unpleasant. Perhaps it was like the void slowly settling in. It came with a bad sensation, though. It just… Didn’t feel right. It wasn’t supposed to be like this. This had been her favourite place. There was the scent of heather and lavender from the plants that grew nearby, there was the quiet movement of the wind against the pond, it was the place she had envisioned when she had faced the universe just that week before – but it wasn’t right. Perhaps it was the cold. Perhaps it was that void approaching in order to slowly drag her under, and for real, this time. Perhaps it was the fact that she was alone.</em>

Her Starfleet career had been over one-hundred years of assisting others, never going a day without interaction of some kind. No matter where she travelled there was always someone with her – family, colleagues, a crew. The familiarity which usually came from this area had vanished. There was no encompassing aura or flurry of empathic feeling. Starfleet Medical had been her home, and now it was betraying her. The entire area had gone cold, and-</em>

<em>No, no. She was panicking. It had been the same when Seann had died, hadn’t it? And the same for Jamie, too. There had been the panic back then, the sensation of fear… But it had washed away with acceptance and peace as they became one with the world around them. It was inevitable, leaving. It was inevitable, and it was her time. So why was she… Why was she afraid? Why did she keep trying to fight it even though she knew this was her fate?</em> 

<em>She was ready to leave. She had been ready to leave for quite some time, now- or had she been? She had held on with the reason that</em> <em><strong>others</strong></em> <em>were not ready for her leaving, but… It may well have been her. It had been her reluctance, not that of anyone else’s. And it was foolish, really. She had experienced a long enough life. Phenna</em> <em><strong>knew</strong></em> <em>that it was her time – and yet, she still found herself afraid.</em>

Fear was going to cause her more pain. Fear… Fear wasn’t the way. She had to let go of the fear. She had to give in and find peace instead. Was there not another world awaiting her after this? Perhaps there would be some sort of afterlife like it was so often envisioned by people throughout countless species. There was only one thing that she wanted out of this departure, though. All she wanted – and all she had wanted over all of those years – was a reunion.</em>

<em>It had been over one-hundred years since she had last seen them. Jamie, with the accent she had stolen and the light-hearted attitude that she had adopted too. And Seann – her Seann, who always found the light in everything, who had taught her to be happy despite the end. There had been nothing,</em> <em><strong>nothing</strong></em> <em>that had ever replaced the feeling of the loss. Years had been spent developing programmes at Starfleet Medical. Years had been spent tending to other people, trying to ensure the best for them – and for all of those years, it had helped. Nothing had ever filled the void, though. Nothing.</em> 

<em>Perhaps they would be waiting for her, she thought to herself as she settled into the peace, refusing to give into the fear. No one had ever witnessed some sort of afterlife reunion before. It wasn’t documented amidst any of the Continuum. Maybe they would be waiting with open arms. Maybe they would welcome her home. Maybe they would tell her how much they had missed her, or maybe it would be like there had been no time away at all. Maybe. Maybe…</em>

It was terrifying, exhilarating, and she didn’t know how to feel. How would the others feel? Would they despise her for leaving them? Would they grieve for her? Would they find themselves enveloped in a loss that she could not help them to navigate, one caused by her? No. This… This was Starfleet. These officers were strong. These officers knew better. And if any of them had ever listened to any of her teachings, then they would know that the pain would not last. Grief… It was fleeting. You would always mourn for the times you had lost. But what mattered was looking back on the times you</em> <em><strong>had.</strong></em>

<em>The cold seemed to stop biting so much with that revelation. It was… Comfortable, instead, like some sort of second skin. The air had gone still, there was no sound of the rush of the wind – and with every inhale she could sense it. Ground below. Sky above. Life within. Energy making everything, embraced in the ebb and flow of the universe. It tugged at her like the tide trying to gently drag someone away.</em> <em><strong>Come home. Come home.

This… So this was it, then, she wondered to herself as that dance of starlight began, no longer violent flames but more akin to a candle slowly finding brightness. So this was it.</em>

<em>Shimmering light overtook her slowly, leaving her to her thoughts in those final minutes. It brought her a sense of peace that she had been searching for for so, so long. Everyone else would be okay. And she… She would be okay, too. No matter what this next step brought her, she would be okay. She would be with Jaime and Seann. She would be okay. She would be okay.</em> <em><strong>She would be okay.</strong></em> 

<em>Starlight began to flicker away into stardust. It was swept up in the soft breeze, glistening brightly before flickering out. From stardust everyone was born and it was to stardust that she now returned. From the tips of her fingers and downwards, from the roots of her hair to the end – until the entirety of her form was enveloped in this shimmering glow.</em>

<em>Individual particles seemed to fade out into the night. One by one they flickered brightly, becoming one with the light… And slowly they dimmed, leaving only her wheelchair and no occupant left before the pond.</em>

It wasn’t often that you found people hurriedly sprinting down the corridors here. This was the home of Starfleet Psychosocial Support, an establishment which generally upheld a calm atmosphere considering it housed the offices of numerous of the fleet’s counsellors. It was completely untoward that two figures would be on a chase through the corridors, then, the elder of which already winded and struggling to keep up.</em> 

“Benji, <em>please</em> stop running!” <em>Olivria called while rounding another corner, outstretching a hand to catch it around the doorframe and attempt to swing herself around after the young officer. It was rather evident that running was not what the Bolian was built for. Stamina perhaps, but an all-out sprint? This wasn’t what she wanted to be doing with her day.</em> “Just – slow down, please. We can talk about this-“ <em>a gasped inhale, trying to catch her breath</em> “-it’s my job, I promise that I’ll listen!” 

<em>The Bolian’s brain outmatched that of her running ability, and thankfully it paid off. Benji had ran the route that she had been trying to influence, and had turned directly into a stairwell. There was a window to the back, the lift to the side (which was not ready to ascend,) and no way of escape. While there was a sense of guilt for having cornered the Trill it really had been the only available option. A hand on the doorframe – both to stop Benji from trying to sprint past and for stability as she tried to regain her breath – she shook her head.</em> “Please. All I want to do is talk – to help you. Please, Benji…”</span>

The meltdown had been approaching for days and she had staved it off, attempting to ignore the horror and desolation and every shred of emotion that she hated. To begin with she had put on a strong front and kept working in order to support the rest of the division – by some miracle she had been stood down as the interim surgeon general but she was still expected to</em> <em><strong>help,</strong></em> <em>as much as she hated it.</em>

<em>Help had not been just in terms of medical ability though. Help had been in terms of staffing, organisation of structures, trying to ensure that the UFHC and Psychosocial Network were going to keep functioning despite the weight of the sudden change. She had managed it, with reluctance, considering how she did not enjoy administration but more than certainly had the mind to work out who went best and where. It was nothing to do with the job that had made her snap. It was when the new Surgeon General brought up the</em> <em><strong>funeral</strong></em> <em>of all things that her composure had began to slip. No amount of aggressively squeezing a stress ball or tapping her feet could stop it, and soon enough, the discomfort was joined by anger as well.</em>

<div class="quote">I am deeply sorry for my actions that took place yesterday. What was said wasnt right of me and I can understand now why you think of me as a horrible person. We are all going through tough times right now and its not right for any of us to shut eachother out, but I am mostly pointing towards myself in this case. Phenna was a very important person in my life and now shes gone, coping is hard enough, but you asked for help and I never offered it.  
</div>&gt; 
<div class="quote">That is something that I should work on, being a security officer isnt about butting into peoples personal dillemas and I should have seen that from the beggining. I understand if you dislike me for what I said, but I only ask for forgiveness and I am here to lend a hand if needed.

Serial number: 4Z31-103-295S

Stardate: 154980.3
<div class="pre pre--multiline nohighlight"> Greetings, I have a proposal for an ambitious project I’d like to undertake, I’ve had this idea for a long while, and I think it will be the next evolution of the medical technology we use today. I call them, Biodrones, or Nanotechnology if you prefer. The Borg nanoprobe was actually my inspiration for this idea; but instead of assimilating people, these small sophisticated devices are intended to perform a wide range of operations, from removing something as simple as a zit to something as complicated as a craniotomy, in essence, nanobots will serve as miniature surgeons that can be used to repair damaged cells or entirely replace intracellular structures. Moreover, they can replicate themselves(in theory) to correct a genetic deficiency or replace DNA molecules to eradicate disease. The Drones are not intended at all to replace the tools used by medical officers today or replace the officers themselves. It will be used in unison alongside traditional instruments. Although on some vessels, they *will* be replacing the tools on ships with small tight medical facilities where equipment and medical personnel might be scarce, such as the Raven-Type or Research vessels. They should shine in field medicine where the tools are limited. Although, this project will take an excruciating amount of time, I am confident it could be done. </div></span>

Olivria had gotten used to it over the years. At the start of every night she had made a habit of going around certain wards and checking up on different aspects of their work. Then it was straight to her office, conducting conference calls and going through the masses of reports to see where their response was required.</em> 

<em>She was on a call Utopia Planitia in regards to a refit when the young petty officer suddenly burst in. Olivria had turned around in an instant, muting the call with a swipe of her hand and stating,</em> &quot;hold for me for just a moment, sorry, Commander,&quot; <em>before positively</em> <em><strong>glaring</strong></em> <em>at the officer who had entered. There had been an immediate response to snap at her and demand to know what the woman was doing. The Petty Officer&#39;s words got there first, though. Olivria froze from where she had been just about to speak, seeming blank for a moment before the words sunk in.</em> &quot;What- What do you mean, Petty Officer? <em>Sinoussi</em> is on the map, I was checking up on their location only twenty minutes ago.&quot;</span>

<em>She shook her head, entirely sure she could certainly read it for herself but she said it anyway.</em> “There were no survivors, none at all.“ <em>Saying it made it all far too real for Helena to bear but she stood her ground, she’d have time to cry after she was back in her room. Baby steps, one minute after the next and she’d be alright. Now wordless, Helena bit the inside of her cheek hard enough to draw blood which now served as a distraction from the caving of her chest and the grief that came with loosing an entire ship, especially an explicitly medical one.</em></span>

<em>She was rambling instead of acknowledging the truth. The Bolian stared at the PADD in front of her. The evidence was right there - the Sinoussi&#39;s mark upon the map being there one second and blinking out the next. She pushed the PADD aside. Logging onto the console - and hanging up on Utopia Planitia on the way without a word - she verified it again. Then from another satellite reading. Then from another starbase reading. Every single dot on the map was the same.</em> 

<em>There had been a distress call put out, it stated here. Two other ships had just warped into the range of the Sinoussi&#39;s last known location. It was with trepidation that Olivria remotely accessed their sensors to watch the scans that they performed - and the teal colour of her skin seemed to drain from her face as they verified the count. Of the crew of 600 and the civilian evacuation capacity of 600 more, there wasn&#39;t a single survivor.</em></span>
