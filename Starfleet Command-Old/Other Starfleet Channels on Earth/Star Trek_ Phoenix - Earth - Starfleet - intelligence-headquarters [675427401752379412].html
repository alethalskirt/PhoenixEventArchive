The room was wide and spacious, almost like a rectangular exam hall with the wide desks laid out. There was monitoring equipment here and there, machines built for certain cyphers dotted around the room. To every angle there was the hum and clack of machinery from the adjacent rooms, but the hall itself was silent. Pinned to a whiteboard on one side were this morning’s warm up: always brainteasters of some form, whether it was sudoku or an equation or an ancient cypher to break. To the back there was the giant transparent whiteboard which was typically reserved for the latest and most prominent cypher they were working on - cyphertext and plaintext and numerous equations written underneath in a neat hand. No one seemed to have touched it since Giles had left.</em>

<em>Giles kept on walking, seemingly not processing what he had just said... And then did a double-take.</em> “Why I never - it <em>is</em> our very own Copernicus King. Who let you in? I don’t recall even giving you our location, yet.”</span>

Before clapping both hands together.</em> &quot;Form up!&quot; <em>He called, and immediately his team of mathematicians and linguists alike scrambled to stand in a semicircle around the board, Cairo leading them at the top. Laika darted around as if to herd them all together, like a sheepdog of old.</em> 

&quot;Right...&quot; <em>Giles started after having located a clean section of the board.</em> &quot;Welcome to the Tal Shiar&#39;s latest cypher; ladies, gentlemen, and others. Because it holds a resemblance to their old cypher and because I&#39;m boring and unoriginal, we&#39;re going to call it ZhinKat II.&quot; <em>At the top of the page he re-wrote the original message.</em> &quot;As you can already see, this isn&#39;t regular Romulan. Half of these symbols are used for their computer script, the other half are used in their ancient literature... Hence why it all looks slightly off. The crafty buggers combined the two.&quot; 

&quot;If you convert it into their computer script you don&#39;t get anywhere, which is also rather crafty of them, considering how you would expect them to use a more modern method of writing. If you put it <em>all</em> into old Romulan literature scripture, however, you get this...&quot; <em>He wrote another line underneath the first, all the symbols looking to be the same style, now.</em> &quot;From there, you can put it into usual Romulan text, accounting for the alphabetical differences throughout the years - the combination and removal of certain letters, for example.&quot; <em>Another line.</em>

I went for decryption.&quot; <em>To the left-hand side he then scrawled out a quick equation.</em> &quot;That there is their encryption method on a standard ZhinKat shift... But watch. On the 15th you only get so far - and yes, they altered the shift to 15 this time... And have to factor in another line.&quot; <em>Quickly, Giles added another line into his equation.</em> &quot;They reversed it by 0.347. Don&#39;t ask my how I got that number, because I just know...&quot; 

<em>From there yet another line was written out in surprisingly neat handwriting: Romulan plaintext.</em> &quot;From there, all you have to do is translate. It&#39;s written in heavy dialect and accent in order to try to throw us off, so let me alter that to a base Romulan for us...&quot; <em>Yet another line...</em> &quot;And now? We can translate into Standard.&quot; <em>And another - finally displaying the results. Numerous lines of working and a stupidly long equation later and it bore the decrypted message: &quot;Subadmiral Uaefv to Subadmiral Hhaetn, proceed to SSC 024 - mark 120 - mark 005. Await further orders...&quot; Giles stepped back and turned to look to the group.</em> &quot;And there we have it, ladies, gentlemen, and others...

When it came down to it, she wasn’t really a cryptologist. Sure she had come to understand the numbers over the years, but it wasn’t her main function here. She was a comms technician, the submarine that served as Starfleet’s most powerful relay was her home. Normally she wouldn’t spend much time here at Intelligence at all but it was where she had to be now.</em> 

<em>She hadn’t really understood why Giles had elected her as his second all those years ago. It was probably because he didn’t understand enough of the comms-tech side and needed someone to handle it. He was a mathematician through and through; the rest bored him. The issue with him being a mathematician was that he did the majority of the work. Everyone else worked on minor ciphers; anything that couldn’t be broken was sent to Giles. He had set the basis for multiple of them during his time for Section 31 – as a result, he knew how to break them.</em> 

<em>Right now they were struggling. Cairo had went through yet another screaming match at the younger kids and stalked off to Giles’s office, slamming the door behind her. Using this place didn’t feel right. It wasn’t hers. I mean, not that she cared. She wouldn’t have to care soon.</em> 

<em>She logged onto the computer, booting up her secure channel. Their transaction had finally come through. All that GPL was sitting safe in her bank account… And now a certain Starfleet admiral was offering her the same if Cairo would support the cause; take out the admiralty so they could march on the Breen. Was it worth it? She already had enough. But imagine what you could do with</em> <em><strong>more.</strong></em> <em>She could have an entire island on some far-off colony, all to herself…</em> 

<em>Betray the first lot by siding with the second. Fuck it. Why not?</em>

Even though he had told his staff to quieten down they were still too loud for his liking, resulting in him dragging his transparent whiteboard through here and working from the safety of his office instead. With glasses on and marker pen in hand he had ended up staring at the formulae in front of him, trying to discern</em> <em><strong>anything.</strong></em> <em>He had managed to translate the script back to Standard but now he was more than stuck. Laika seemed to sense this, sat beside him upon the floor, tail wagging and occasionally yapping in an attempt to cheer him up.</em></span>

The Cardassian literally sat with his feet up against the base of his console, incredibly bored... until keen yellow eyes looked down at the console in front of him - and there it was. A transmission for him to decode. Woooooonderful. Sitting up reluctantly green eyes studied it with intent: Tal Shiar. Okay then. Breaking their codes nowadays was a piece of larish pie since they&#39;d learned of the intelligence organization&#39;s oh-so-secret ZhinKat II encoding method.</em> 

<em>Well. Time to get to work. He typed away at the screen, expertly working through the encryption protocols. When he finally did get to see the message, in full though... there was no more trace of boredom then. He jumped up from his seat and sped straight to Giles&#39; office as fast as his feet could carry him. Damn these scaly toes!</em> &quot;We... have a slight problem.

And it would be difficult to replace all of Intel so suddenly. Just recalling all our operatives alone is a bloody nightmare. We&#39;ve got some where they can&#39;t readily contact the Federation, or they&#39;re outside of Federation space, very deep undercover like the MADD boys. Then you&#39;ve got operatives in the various Starbase, ships, outposts....they have to know its just not possible and there&#39;s too much red tape they&#39;d have to sift through. And not to mention they would have <em>re-recruit</em> and <em>retrain</em> hundreds of new agents and honestly? Some of the work we&#39;re able to do is <em>because</em> we have those multiple years of experience.&quot; <em>He sighed and rubbed his neck, this situation was agitating the hell out of him.

&quot;Regardless of what they say.....Starfleet proper has to see its just not workable to replace 99.99957% of an entire division and expect the same results as before.&quot;</span>

<em>And it was here where she, who was wearing the high-heeled boots making the clicking sounds that echoed through the near-silent halls, felt most at home. She’d been here before, of course - otherwise, why would she have been promoted? - but never had the woman found herself heading to a room with a door with her name on the display beside. At least, not her real name, and not here. Other places, yes, but never here.</em>

<em>For such a technologically advanced department, the interior was oddly old-fashioned. It was more secure that way, she supposed. A wooden desk was far less likely to harbour a virus than one with a computer inside it, not to mention it was far easier to dispose of in exigent circumstances. Stepping around the desk, Theo settled into her wooden chair, the sort with a cushion on the seat that spun, and she crossed her legs politely, shifting slightly. ‘Yes, yes, this will do nicely.’</em>

<em>Of course, she couldn’t sit and enjoy her chair forever. The new Head of MADD could only go so long without doing actual work, so she pulled out her PADD and began scrolling through what seemed like years&#39; worth of reports and paperwork. Oh. Simply lovely.</em></span>

It was strange that the chatter had now been replaced by silence. Heads down and entirely focussed on their work, the staff here did not have time to chat. Quick words were exchanged when needs be but other than that everyone seemed pre-occupied – encrypting communications messages and channels to ensure they could not be intercepted, decrypting others in a desperate effort to gather information, and over-all trying to keep Starfleet’s communications network alive.</em> 

<em>For Giles it had been entirely hectic. As standard he co-ordinated the department. He ensured that everyone was set up and working for the day. He ensured that Starfleet Operations were fixing relays and stations and monitors. He dispatched that bloody submarine to serve as a relay should it be required, he poured over the work of his staff and stared at letters and numbers until they seemed to be burned into his eyes. All of the most difficult encryptions and ciphers came to him. If the computer began to struggle then it would go to him – a set of Trill eyes to try to piece it apart where the computer could not.</em> 

<em>It did not often work, though. The computer was faster than everyone, it was smarter than everyone – and it was no secret that his staff were being put out of a job by the system. Technology had such a capability – the capability to make the Federation safer – and if he could not surpass it then there was no need for him. It was a harrowing time and the thought that the division might be closed</em> <em><strong>at</strong></em> <em>such a harrowing time did not feel right at all. Surely they might need the help of CRCO if these instances out there kept occurring? Or maybe faith would be lost in the division entirely – trust falling to the computers instead.</em>

As such he had pre-occupied himself with trying to prove that his staff – or perhaps just himself – could do better. Sometimes you needed a real-life organic mind in order to piece something apart. History and mathematics had always knitted together perfectly inside his own head and it was as such that he found himself staring at ancient script that had suddenly turned modern; history coming to life once more. Once upon a time it had been historians pouring over texts written in this hand. Now it was down to the cryptologists as transmissions in that alphabet were newly sent, all of which containing information that could not be ignored.</em> 

<em>He had been staring at it for too long. He knew the script inside and out but their methods had changed. Technologically advanced, they always had been – and now they were better than both Giles</em> <em><strong>and</strong></em> <em>the computer. It wasn’t good enough. To add to the not good enough, however, was the sound of his console bleeping out a new message that had automatically filtered through to him to check over – any priority message from one of his own colleagues to someone in the field would be encrypted, of course, and such an encryption would be double checked by him.</em> 

<em>What caught the mathematician’s eye was the fact that this cipher was not the normal one utilised by Intelligence. It was not one that he had made or one that he had signed off on; it was new, different, and something that he immediately did not like. Brow furrowed, he had set to work immediately, pouring over numbers and symbols and running it through the computer until they had the results at exactly the same time – that proved it, didn’t it? That the computer wasn’t faster than him.</em>

It was following the disappearance of Hyunsik Hwang that Intelligence had opted to elect a new head of the Maintaining and Deputising Division. It was with distaste that Giles found the position being taken by someone he did not know. The Trill was an Intelligence officer – it would be foolish to blindly trust people you did not know – and as such he had done his digging.

Perhaps his past was catching up with him. He wouldn’t need to worry about the computers if</em> <em><strong>they</strong></em> <em>got to him instead.</em> 

<em>But no, no, he had to tell himself – his colleague had every right to be suspicious! Who wouldn’t be suspicious when a blade that once belonged to the other division head suddenly appeared sunk into a Starfleet captain’s gut instead of being locked away in the museum where you had once left it? Of course it was suspicious, and the woman had every right to investigate. She had every right to hide the transmission from him (or at least attempt to,) but-</em> 

<em>The possibility was still there – and Giles’s paranoia was still there with it.</em> 

<em>Laika jolted at the sound of Giles’s chair suddenly being slid back, the dog going from asleep to at her owner’s side almost instantaneously. The lights in his office were shut off, the door locked (via biometrics, of course), and it was through the main hall of his own division that he now seemed to stalk. His gait usually consisted of loping strides that were marked with a limp – testament to his health, it seemed – but every so often the prowling gait emerged instead. It was only adopted when somebody was in trouble and Giles had taken the position of a hunter going after its prey.</em>

<em>He knew his way through the offices and command and control rooms alike. He knew exactly where was going – of course he did, he had the entire building plan memorised just in case he ever required it – and it was as such that it did not take long for him to end up stood right outside the door which had a newly engraved plaque upon it. ‘Theodosia Coleridge’ was the officer who had replaced Hyunsik Hwang – and she was the officer who Giles already found a fair hint of distaste and mistrust towards.</em> 

<em>Refusing to acknowledge those emotions would not get him anywhere, though. With Laika diligently sat at his heels and him with posture as perfect as he could, he paused to smooth down the lapels of his suit jacket before chiming the door.</em></span>

No, she had the responsibility of finding patterns, tracking data points, all in an attempt to ensure that the enemy had no moles, no double-agents nestled within the Federation. So far? Nothing. Nothing except one strange little knife once used by a Trill, oh-so-many years ago, the one that caused the little conflict between Theo and that Trill in the first place (a conflict that she was yet unaware of). There was truly nothing else, not yet - if there were, it would already be on her desk or in her web.

People knew how to be serious out in the field but here, somewhere that had once been</em> <em><strong>home,</strong></em> <em>they knew that they were allowed to be people instead of machines.</em> 

<em>How the times had changed.</em>

<em>Laika responded to the call to enter first. The dog was trained to, of course, and with one law forwards she triggered the door to slide open. The mess of fur barely held back by the harness may well have made the dog look relatively unimposing. It was clear that Laika was no guard dog - trained to be one if required, yes, but bearing no sort of ferocity nor hardiness at present. She merely took her place sat neatly in front of the desk, waiting for Giles to step in behind her.</em>

<em>And it was exactly that that he did, those strangely flickering eyes squinting from behind the glasses he wore, gaze being swept over the room to take everything in. It was with severe distaste that he noted the desk and chairs. What was this, an attempt to go back to the dark ages? The desk was</em> <em><strong>wooden</strong></em> <em>of all things with no form of console integration. There was disliking the system as it caught up to you but being aware of it&#39;s benefits - and then there was</em> <em><strong>this.</strong></em> <em>Even Giles valued the integration of technology into modern-day society and people&#39;s everyday lives. Coleridge, it seemed, did not.</em>

What wouldn’t make sense was getting every detail right, even if she’d seen them so many times in her research.</em>

<em>Normally, it would be considered polite to stand from one’s desk to shake a peer’s hand… but the woman didn’t do that. She was far too busy <strong>studying</strong> how Giles looked around the room: how his eyes lingered on the desk, the chairs… the strange little pause as he presumably made some sort of a face.

<em>’Now, now’s the critical moment,’ she noted to herself.

<em>Giles had made an effort to do that surface analysis in return. Looking a person over and taking in their posture, clothing, how they did their hair… It could only tell you so much.

<em>In stark contrast to Giles&#39; wheezing breath and failing posture, Theo was of the sort who was consistently and constantly aware of every little detail of their body and what it was doing. Her breathing was silent, her movements not graceful, per say, but conscious and thoroughly intentional. An inherent trait of an ex-Section 31 agent... Or so she had thought. It struck Coleridge as strange, actually, how Giles seemed to be so unaware - did he know that he was grinding his teeth? Or would that have gotten him killed in a delicate situation? Certainly not the latter, she hoped... Though perhaps the apparent computer genius had never had a field assignment with S31, instead staying locked away where it was safe and where he never had to feel blood on his hands. Perhaps he was one of the lucky ones. Of course, she didn&#39;t have access to his medical file, but perhaps his illness, whatever it was, affected his career. Maybe he was one-foot-in-the-grave already, what with that terribly yellow cast over his face. Maybe he was working with the enemy. Maybe he thought their technology could cure him.</em>

But there was something else at play - that horrible sense of supremacy, woven with apathy, a cold, bitter exterior, and an affinity for practicality. That much was obvious from the way her office was arranged, the way her hair was &quot;styled&quot; - if a quick brush for neatness&#39; sake could be called styling - and the almost haughty trench coat she wore; how she presented herself was yet another balancing act between superiority and not giving a rat&#39;s arse what others thought of her.</em>

But she did have at least a little restraint. How inconvenient it was that the Trill was aware of her little operation... it would certainly be a bit of a roadblock unless he decided to simply look away from what he knew - which would, of course, make him seem much less suspicious. Oh, but then it would turn into mind games: &#39;he knows that I know that he knows that I know&#39; and so on. How Coleridge hated those. No, that would certainly have to be avoided.</em>

<em>Oh, but then again, there was the need to keep her enemies close. If the Trill was guilty, then letting him be aware of the investigation but not be involved could prove disastrous. Destroying evidence, clearing records, finding alibis, <strong>disappearing key people</strong> - he couldn&#39;t be allowed to do any of that. A tiny voice in the back of Coleridge&#39;s head recalled the days where such an inconvenient person would simply be killed - but she wasn&#39;t a savage anymore, even if she remembered being one. What was she supposed to do? How could she ensure that the Federation remained safe?</em>

<em>There was never an easy answer with these things, that she already knew. Her plan had been ruined badly and early. If war did break out, Intel would need to be unified… but it was hard to be unified if she didn&#39;t trust her colleagues. Investigations and &#39;cloak-and-dagger&#39; operations only tore apart any potential for trust further, that she knew (and that was specifically <strong>why</strong> she hadn&#39;t wanted the Trill to find out) but if they were necessary, they were necessary. Theodosia <strong>couldn&#39;t</strong> trust Giles, not fully, not under the circumstances, even if she wanted to. He was proving to be far too dangerous for that.</em></span>

<em>After a moment, Coleridge sighed, somewhere between annoyed and simply wound up.</em>

<em>What a fantastic first impression she&#39;d made. The way he&#39;d sat up - did he view her as a threat? Or was it that he was simply preparing to make his point?

<div class="quote">Message Directed to the division of CSID:
</div>
&quot;This is Admiral France of Starfleet Security. As you might have known already, Starfleet has been continuously threatened by the Iconians. Our valued officers have been captured and apparently tortured to an extent, whilst entire ships have been attacked on.  A meeting was put in place and we discussed our situation yesterday.&quot;

&quot;Now I am not here to tell you to do your job like you already have been doing. The Admiralty have left your division to your own devices for quite sometime. However, there is a task which might benefit you in terms of work. One of the members of the Admiralty, one &quot;Kohl th&#39;Ereven&quot; mentioned the support of Elija Noi, a criminal runaway who has been under our radar for the past few months. With the new threat of the Iconians, we believe that Noi could use this threat to his advantage. Our fear is that he already has sided with the Iconians due to his persuasive nature. Your task would be to track him down and capture him, before he could pose a big enough threat to Starfleet as a whole.&quot;

&quot;Finally, there is another task which we would like you to pursue, and that would be Interrogation of Admiral th&quot;Ereven. The Admiralty feels as though he might be siding with him, the admiral expressed a rather calm nature when mentioning his name and even went as far as to mention that we could try contacting him. We fear that the Admiral knows where Noi is, and can contact him. In which case, due to our current situation, we cannot risk anything. That is everything I have for you as of now. If you have any questions or pieces of information that you wish to speak to me about, you can always contact me, I hope this message reaches you well. Admiral France, out.&quot;

<u>The interrogation of Admiral th&#39;Ereven</u>

We&#39;ve already taken care of this. We nabbed him as soon as he stepped out of Starfleet Command after your last meeting. As you can imagine he was rather... frustrated... at the sudden locution. Nonetheless we conducted all the tests we have and you may be pleased to find out that the Admiral, for all his bluster and yelling, suggested mister Noi in an act of desparation - and yes, without offense, I understand that none of you all have been getting much sleep. That contributed too, at least, according to the physician who examined him. Don&#39;t worry - if he does turn we have means of... eliminating him.</div></span>

Once again we have already taken care of this - though admittedly with far less pretty results, in that we have failed to take care of it. You see, we have a rather interesting situation; there are a total of four Nois currently existing. One was expedited back to us from Republic custody, two were fired upon after posing as president Ravaal&#39;s security detail and, well, there&#39;s the Noi that&#39;s working within the ranks of section 31. Close examination of the first three has revealed that, lo and behold, they are clones, indicated by the gene degredatiom sequence that we observed in their cells. Whoever cloned these was an expert - we really had to dig quite hard to find it. With our examiner&#39;s consent I&#39;ve attached the postmortem reports for the perusal of you and the Admiralty. 

It gets interesting from here. Each and every clone is controlled separately by a chip implanted in their neocortexes. I&#39;ve also attached the schematics of that for reference. This implant is a telepathic extender - an amplifier if you will, a receiver. It&#39;s nothing we&#39;ve ever seen before - well, at least, in this universe. I say this because it has an Imperial Starfleet signature. We suspect that Noi himself doesn&#39;t belong either. Regardless, we&#39;ve managed to use a little bit of ferreting around in their components to find his actual location: a... caf&#233;... on the Federation colony of Ataxia Minor. We&#39;ve already sent two teams to facilitate his recovery.</div></span>

I already know about Intels involvement with the capture of the clones, as I have been informed by multiple officers about this... thanks for the referesher however. However I main point of discussion is the teams that have apparently gone &quot;Missing&quot; weeks ago, the do coincide with the dissapearances of the other officers, gone without a trace? No way of tracking them down? That could lead us to believe that Noi has the same tactics as the iconians.... However, as bad as the Iconians currently are, I feel like my priorities, and yours as well, have been set... As for how we proceed, I would like to talk to the head of your department as they would be the one to put the final say in all this, I you could direct this message to her, it would be much appreciated.

<em>After a beat, Theo cleared the space between herself and the Trill&#39;s desk in only a few steps.

He was aware of the alternate interpretation; one that suggested he was attempting to get away, but- no, he was too tired to care.</em>

She was new, she was former Section 31, she would have to get anybody with a similar background out of her way in case they became suspicious. The thought made his stomach churn even more. Paranoid, Giles, always paranoid. She wasn&#39;t a threat to Starfleet. Just... To you, maybe.</em> 

<em>The Trill had to grind his teeth together as those strangely-glowing eyes seemed to jolt with light, seemingly edged onwards by the growing shift in emotion. This really want his day.</em>

And- the talk of coming here <em>yourself?</em>&quot; <em>The bark of a laugh he gave was entirely incredulous.</em> &quot;Look at me! Do you really think that <em>I</em> would come anywhere <em>near</em> taking down <em>you?</em> You&#39;d have to be bloody blind to even think it.&quot; 

<em>Giles knew that he was going too far - that he had to reel himself in or this conversation was going to go in no direction that would be of any help to him. He forced out a slow exhale in an attempt to just</em> <em><strong>calm down,</strong></em> <em>the exhaustion hitting all at once as the anger dissipated. His voice quietened. Was this going to sound like begging instead of just being an explanation? Possibly.</em> 

&quot;Look at me, Ms. Coleridge. <em>Please.</em> Consider the facts. I know that it looks as if you have evidence there in front of you but something... Someth- <em>Something</em> is not right with it. I do not have <em>anything</em> to do with these Iconian attacks. I wouldn&#39;t betray the Federation like that - and I <em>certainly</em> wouldn&#39;t betray Starfleet. Please - at least try to find the common ground here. Did they not give us both a new chance at life? Why would I - you - <em>we</em> ever betray those who saved us?&quot;</span>

Surely he knew that this wasn&#39;t a negotiation or really a debate - it was an investigation, and Coleridge was <strong>doing her job</strong> to ensure it went how it needed to go. If she simply believed him, it would reflect poorly on <strong>both</strong> of them. And trying to use her past against her? To manipulate her and try to garner sympathy? Coleridge <strong>wouldn&#39;t</strong> fall for it.</em>

&quot;I never said that you wouldn&#39;t be allowed to defend yourself. I haven&#39;t stopped you from doing so. And it&#39;s completely irrational for you to chide me for being <em>cautious</em> - do you really expect me to believe that you haven&#39;t got a phaser here, or worse?&quot; <em>Theodosia shook her head as well, a quicker, jerkier shake to emphasize the question. He was getting so desperate, it was almost sad. She&#39;d really expected better from him, without the appeals to emotion at least.</em>

<em>But even with the softening of both their voices, Theo&#39;s stance remained not aggressive, but prepared. If the argument escalated into violence, she was ready to defend herself and Ms. France, but there was nothing in her body language to <strong>provoke</strong> violence. Giles had seemed to calm down, yes, but the possibility of it being a ruse to catch Coleridge off-guard was apparent in her mind.</em></span>

Anything.</em> &quot;I&#39;m glad that you can at least consider that on the basis of it being <em>logical</em> more than anything. At least you can appeal to our security standards and sense of union instead of our intrinsic emotion. The Vulcans will be pleased, if not anybody else.&quot;</span>

Perhaps they were both just too alike when it came to something like this - both trying to prove themselves better than one another, locked in some continuous petty argument that should have only been pursued by children and not professional adults.</em> 

<em>At least France seemed to have his back - somewhat. It seemed as if she was trying to play the middle ground and remain neutral; acknowledging that he may not have any form of evidence to provide at the moment but also knowing that he might be able to procure it eventually. At least she didn&#39;t seem so hellbent on convicting him so early. Her snark back at Coleridge only added to the tension in the room, though. It made him yearn for some sort of civil conversation even if he had been contributing to the issue in the first place. Did he not have the right to, though? He wondered how the other two might have reacted if they were in his place. Surely they would be just as defensive if they were being wrongfully accused, too.</em>

<em>It was rather ironic that as soon as France began talking about Laika that the dog reappeared, once again nudging him away from the desk and into the more open section by the door. She continued to nudge at his leg before standing diligently by his side, waiting. There was no verbal response from Giles, gaze entirely vacant. The last sentence or so had given way to ringing in his ears. There was another strange flicker of his eyes, an eerily strangled exhale -- and then legs buckled, leaving Laika scrambling behind him to break the fall.</em></span>

It was clear as day what he&#39;d done. What about the comfort of the officers he&#39;d helped kill? Regular Starfleet had always seemed just a little strange to her, but the woman still found it surprising that they&#39;d prioritize the comfort of a <strong>traitor</strong> - a word she used without the sarcasm that France put into it. That&#39;s what he was, and Theo had no interest in &quot;softening the blow&quot; or &quot;dignity&quot; or anything of the sort. As France was talking, Coleridge sighed under her breath, shaking her head in annoyance. Why were people like this?</em>

<em>And even by the time Giles fell, Coleridge hadn&#39;t yet turned back towards France, undoubtedly waiting to give her a taste of the same venomous sass she&#39;d used with Giles, but the sound of something - someone - falling had her spinning on her heel to see what had happened. She&#39;d expected to find France on the ground, the Trill somehow out of the cuffs, but what she saw was entirely different. Would the dog be able to catch Giles with his arms behind his back? Maybe not, but there was no way Coleridge could cross the room in time to help her, even if she wanted to. Regardless, Theo began counting the seconds as they passed - she wasn&#39;t entirely sure whether it was a seizure or a fainting spell or something else, but she knew that when someone dropped, you start counting. &#39;One, two, three...&#39; she counted in her head, looking quizzically and concernedly at Giles, then the dog, the Nymeria, pursing her lips.</em>

<em>After a moment, she asked,</em> &quot;Does he need Medical?&quot; <em>After all, letting him be injured would help no one - it would only get in the way of reconciliation, and neither Theodosia nor Giles wanted that.</em></span>
